A study of analyst recommendations at the major brokerages shows that Gentherm Inc (Symbol: THRM) is the #86 broker analyst pick among those stocks screened by The Online Investor for strong stock buyback activity.  To make that list, a stock must have repurchased at least 5% of its outstanding shares over the trailing twelve month period.  In forming the rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the list of stocks with strong buyback activity was ranked according to those averages.
