In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 1.45% for Shutterstock Inc, 0.38% for Vontier Corp, and 0.90% for Forward Air Corp.  



In Monday trading, Shutterstock Inc shares are currently up about 0.6%, Vontier Corp shares are up about 1%, and Forward Air Corp shares are up about 0.8% on the day.
