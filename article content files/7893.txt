In trading on Wednesday, shares of the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF (Symbol: BIV) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $73.7353 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond, the RSI reading has hit 29.6 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.4.

A bullish investor could look at BIV's 29.6 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), BIV's low point in its 52 week range is $71.4018 per share, with $85.295 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $73.78.  Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond shares are currently trading off about 0.8% on the day.
