Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned cash to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money.  Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.



At SLR Investment, a filing with the SEC revealed that on Tuesday, Michael S. Gross bought 152,158 shares of SLRC, at a cost of $15.64 each, for a total investment of $2.38M.  So far Gross is in the green, up about 1.9% on their buy based on today's trading high of $15.94.  SLR Investment is trading up about 1.1% on the day Wednesday.  Before this latest buy, Gross purchased SLRC at 2 other times during the past year, for a total investment of $2.06M at an average of $14.99 per share.



And at Pennant Group, there was insider buying on Monday, by Director Barry M. Smith who bought 30,000 shares at a cost of $14.99 each, for a total investment of $449,712.  Pennant Group is trading up about 4.6% on the day Wednesday.  Bargain hunters can bag PNTG at a price even lower than Smith did, with the stock changing hands as low as $13.60 at last check today which is 9.3% below Smith's purchase price.
