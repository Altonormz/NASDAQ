(RTTNews) - After ending yesterday's lackluster session mostly lower, stocks may move to the upside in early trading on Wednesday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a slightly higher open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures up by 0.1 percent.
Overseas strength may carry over onto Wall Street following the release of data showing Chinese factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in more than a decade in February.

The ISM's manufacturing PMI is expected to inch up to 48.0 in February from 47.4 in January, but a reading below 50 would still indicate a contraction.
