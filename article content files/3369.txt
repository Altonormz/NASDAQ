In trading on Friday, shares of the SPDR Dow Jones Global Real Estate ETF (Symbol: RWO) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $40.155 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Dow Jones Global Real Estate, the RSI reading has hit 29.3 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 36.1.

A bullish investor could look at RWO's 29.3 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), RWO's low point in its 52 week range is $36.47 per share, with $55.37 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $40.38.  SPDR Dow Jones Global Real Estate shares are currently trading down about 2.7% on the day.
