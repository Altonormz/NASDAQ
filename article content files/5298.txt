There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on February 27, Enterprise Financial Services Corp's Director, Lyne Andrich, invested $100,004.00 into 1,840 shares of EFSC, for a cost per share of $54.35.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Enterprise Financial Services Corp (Symbol: EFSC) and achieve a cost basis 1.0% cheaper than Andrich, with shares changing hands as low as $53.82 per share.  Enterprise Financial Services Corp shares are currently trading off about 2.9% on the day.
