As a percentage of NEM's recent stock price of $44.61, this dividend works out to approximately 0.90%, so look for shares of Newmont Corp to trade 0.90% lower — all else being equal — when NEM shares open for trading on 3/8/23.













In general, dividends are not always predictable; but looking at the history above can help in judging whether the most recent dividend from NEM is likely to continue, and whether the current estimated yield of 3.59% on annualized basis is a reasonable expectation of annual yield going forward.
