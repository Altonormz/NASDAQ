There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 9, Associated Banc-Corp's CEO, Andrew J. Harmening, invested $99,788.75 into 4,850 shares of ASB, for a cost per share of $20.57.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Wednesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Associated Banc-Corp (Symbol: ASB) and achieve a cost basis 6.7% cheaper than Harmening, with shares changing hands as low as $19.20 per share.  Associated Banc-Corp shares are currently trading down about 4.7% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of ASB shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, ASB's low point in its 52 week range is $17.45 per share, with $25.50 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $19.53.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which ASB insider buying was recorded over the last six months:




The current annualized dividend paid by Associated Banc-Corp is $0.84/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 02/28/2023.
