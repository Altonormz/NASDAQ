In trading on Tuesday, shares of the JETS ETF (Symbol: JETS) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $18.15 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of JETS, the RSI reading has hit 28.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 38.3.

A bullish investor could look at JETS's 28.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), JETS's low point in its 52 week range is $14.7737 per share, with $23.49 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $18.23.  JETS shares are currently trading down about 1.2% on the day.
