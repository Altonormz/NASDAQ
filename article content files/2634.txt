In trading on Monday, shares of the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (Symbol: VO) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $199.33 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Mid-Cap, the RSI reading has hit 28.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at VO's 28.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), VO's low point in its 52 week range is $182.88 per share, with $243.78 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $201.94.  Vanguard Mid-Cap shares are currently trading down about 1.4% on the day.
