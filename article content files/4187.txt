In trading on Thursday, shares of the Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate ETF (Symbol: VNQI) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $40.5394 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate, the RSI reading has hit 28.1 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.2.

A bullish investor could look at VNQI's 28.1 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), VNQI's low point in its 52 week range is $36.02 per share, with $52.95 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $40.61.  Vanguard Global ex-U.S. Real Estate shares are currently trading off about 1.5% on the day.
