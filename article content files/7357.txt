As a percentage of DINO's recent stock price of $50.50, this dividend works out to approximately 0.89%, so look for shares of HF Sinclair Corp to trade 0.89% lower — all else being equal — when DINO shares open for trading on 3/6/23.













In general, dividends are not always predictable; but looking at the history above can help in judging whether the most recent dividend from DINO is likely to continue, and whether the current estimated yield of 3.56% on annualized basis is a reasonable expectation of annual yield going forward.
