At this point, you likely don't need another explainer or tick-tock about the run on Silicon Valley Bank, so let's rewind beyond the tick or the tock.
Hindsight is 20/20, and, looking back, there were more red flags than you'd see on a Carolina beach in October. Here were the biggest, brightest ones that everyone seemed to miss.
For starters, it should now be generally understood that SVB operated less like a typical regional bank and more like the tech industry's personal lending operation. Given that industry's predilection for burning cash en route to, well, not exactly making cash, it isn't surprising that the bank found itself overleveraged.
And it wasn't a secret, either:
Going Once, Going Twice: The FDIC began an auction process for SVB on Saturday, with final bids due Sunday afternoon. While that process is not yet complete, regulators took bold steps to stem the contagion effect of SVB's collapse Sunday evening by guaranteeing the FDIC can protect all of the bank's deposits, and announcing that Signature Bank has been closed by New York State regulators citing "a similar systemic risk exception."
