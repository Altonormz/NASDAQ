Bargain hunters are wise to pay careful attention to insider buying, because although there are many various reasons for an insider to sell a stock, presumably the only reason they would use their hard-earned dollars to make a purchase, is that they expect to make money.  Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.



At Intel, a filing with the SEC revealed that on Thursday, CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger purchased 9,700 shares of INTC, for a cost of $25.68 each, for a total investment of $249,081.  Investors can grab INTC even cheaper than Gelsinger did, with the stock trading as low as $24.73 at last check today -- that's 3.7% under Gelsinger's purchase price.  Intel is trading up about 0.3% on the day Tuesday.  Before this latest buy, Gelsinger bought INTC at 4 other times during the past year, for a total investment of $1.25M at an average of $32.66 per share.



And at Vicarious Surgical, there was insider buying on Thursday, by Director Philip Liang who purchased 37,500 shares at a cost of $2.86 each, for a total investment of $107,141.  Before this latest buy, Liang bought RBOT at 5 other times during the past year, for a total cost of $443,339 at an average of $3.03 per share.  Vicarious Surgical is trading up about 3% on the day Tuesday.
