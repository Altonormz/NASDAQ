In trading on Thursday, shares of the The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (Symbol: XLF) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $33.37 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the RSI reading has hit 24.2 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.2.

A bullish investor could look at XLF's 24.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), XLF's low point in its 52 week range is $29.59 per share, with $40.005 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $33.56.  The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund shares are currently trading off about 4.3% on the day.
