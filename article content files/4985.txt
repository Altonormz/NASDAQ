Yesterday was a fun congressional hearing - if you held puts.
"How many times did the economy fail to fall into a recession after raising the unemployment rate by 1%, as you want to?" asked Senator Warren (edited for clarity).
“I think the number is zero.” replied Chairman Powell. To his credit, he did not try to run circles around the question and gave a straightforward answer.
The rest is history, as the market took a nose-dive and closed -1.53% down.
We highlight two takeaways from this.
First, it’s a range-bound market. We’ve been saying this over and over. Own equities when S&P 500 has a P/E above 17x at your own risk.
Second, the risk of a recession is still here. Powell can hike the front-end but the back end seems anchored and 10y US Treasuries are looking more and more attractive.
