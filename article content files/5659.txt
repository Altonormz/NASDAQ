Adjusted net income for the quarter was $32.5 million or $0.81 per share, compared to $36.0 million or $0.79 per share a year ago.
On average, three analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $0.75 per share for the quarter. Analysts' estimates typically exclude special items. 
Total revenue increased 7 percent to $426.0 million from $398.5 million last year, primarily driven by the performance of Florida division and the delivery of units from New York operations.
