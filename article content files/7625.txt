In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares MBS ETF (Symbol: MBB) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $92.06 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares MBS, the RSI reading has hit 29.5 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.1.

A bullish investor could look at MBB's 29.5 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), MBB's low point in its 52 week range is $88 per share, with $104.895 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $92.05.  iShares MBS shares are currently trading down about 1% on the day.
