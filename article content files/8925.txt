In economic news, Eurozone economic sentiment fell marginally as the weakness in industry and services were partially offset by the increasing confidence in retail and among consumers, survey results from the European Commission showed on Monday. 
Growth in the euro area bank lending continued to weaken and the narrow measure of money supply contracted for the first time on record, reflecting the impact of monetary policy tightening. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector slowed to 3.8 percent from 4.3 percent in December, the European Central Bank reported Monday. The economic confidence index unexpectedly dropped to 99.7 from 99.8 in January, falling for the first time in three months. The reading was forecast to improve to 101.
