There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 10, Washington Federal Inc's Director, Randall H. Talbot, invested $108,850.00 into 3,500 shares of WAFD, for a cost per share of $31.10.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Thursday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Washington Federal Inc (Symbol: WAFD) and achieve a cost basis 2.0% cheaper than Talbot, with shares changing hands as low as $30.47 per share.  Washington Federal Inc shares are currently trading down about 1.8% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of WAFD shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
