In trading on Monday, shares of the TILT ETF (Symbol: TILT) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $147.63 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of TILT, the RSI reading has hit 29.3 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at TILT's 29.3 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), TILT's low point in its 52 week range is $137.43 per share, with $178.25 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $147.63.  TILT shares are currently trading off about 1.7% on the day.
