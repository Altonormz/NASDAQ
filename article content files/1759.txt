In company news, Bowlero (BOWL) still was rising 1.7% late in Tuesday trading, easing from a 4.5% midday advance, after the bowling center chain announced its purchase of Paradise Lanes Entertainment Center, with the 32-lane bowling alley in Tacoma, Washington becoming the company fourth location in Washington state.
