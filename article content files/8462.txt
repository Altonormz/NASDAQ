In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months.  The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.  So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice.  One such company is Virtu Financial Inc - Class A (Symbol: VIRT), which saw buying by Director Joanne Minieri.




Back on November 7, Minieri invested $90,512.40 into 4,000 shares of VIRT, for a cost per share of $22.63.  In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Virtu Financial Inc - Class A (Symbol: VIRT) and achieve a cost basis 18.9% cheaper than Minieri, with shares changing hands as low as $18.36 per share.    It should be noted that Minieri has collected $0.24/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 17.8% on their purchase from a total return basis.  Virtu Financial Inc - Class A shares are currently trading -1.45% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of VIRT shares, versus its 200 day moving average:













Looking at the chart above, VIRT's low point in its 52 week range is $18.36 per share, with $38.63 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $18.40.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which insider buying was recorded over the last six months:




The DividendRank report noted that among the coverage universe, VIRT shares displayed both attractive valuation metrics and strong profitability metrics.  The report also cited the strong quarterly dividend history at Virtu Financial Inc - Class A, and favorable long-term multi-year growth rates in key fundamental data points.

That's what we aim to find using our proprietary DividendRank formula, which ranks the coverage universe based upon our various criteria for both profitability and valuation, to generate a list of the top most 'interesting' stocks, meant for investors as a source of ideas that merit further research.''


The annualized dividend paid by Virtu Financial Inc - Class A is $0.96/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 02/28/2023.
