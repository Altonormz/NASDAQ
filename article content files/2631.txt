In trading on Monday, shares of the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value ETF (Symbol: SLYV) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $73.81 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value, the RSI reading has hit 27.5 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at SLYV's 27.5 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), SLYV's low point in its 52 week range is $66.84 per share, with $86.96 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $74.53.  SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap Value shares are currently trading down about 2.9% on the day.
