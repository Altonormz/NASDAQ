March 8 (Reuters) - The Australian competition regulator said on Wednesday it would probe the country's growing ecosystem of digital platform service providers as part of a five-year inquiry into the sector.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said consumers and businesses are becoming increasingly dependent on products and services offered by digital platforms such as Alphabet GOOGL.O, Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Meta META.O and Microsoft MSFT.O, and it's crucial to examine how the digital giants are expanding their reach.
