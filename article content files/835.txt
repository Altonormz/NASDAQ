   LUXEMBOURG, March 16 (Reuters) - American Airlines
, which gave up rights to two airport slots to Delta Air
Lines'  in 2013, on Thursday lost a court appeal to have
the European Union cancel them for lack of use.

American gave up the takeoff and landing rights at Heathrow
and Philadelphia airports to get antitrust approval for its
merger with US Airway. Airlines may keep a slot in perpetuity
provided they use it regularly. The European Commission picked
Delta to take up the slots.


The EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe's
highest, dismissed American's arguments that Delta did not
fulfil its obligation to use the slots regularly.
  


"The text of the final commitments does not establish a
specific number of frequencies that should be operated by the
prospective entrant to ensure effective competition," the judges
ruled.
  

American complained that Delta had not made appropriate use
of the slots as required under grandfather rights, prompting the
EU competition watchdog to issue a decision in 2018 backing its
rival.

American challenged the decision at the General Court in
2020 but lost. It then appealed to the CJEU.

The case is C-127/21 P, American Airlines v Commission.
