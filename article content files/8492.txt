As the saying goes, there are many possible reasons for an insider to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy -- they expect to make money.  So let's look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.



On Friday, B. Riley Financial's CEO B. Riley Securities, Andrew Moore, made a $367,774 buy of RILY, purchasing 10,000 shares at a cost of $36.78 a piece.  So far Moore is in the green, up about 12.4% on their purchase based on today's trading high of $41.35.  B. Riley Financial is trading up about 6% on the day Tuesday.  Before this latest buy, Moore bought RILY at 3 other times during the past year, for a total cost of $1.47M at an average of $42.14 per share.



And at Twilio, there was insider buying on Friday, by Director Donna Dubinsky who bought 3,995 shares at a cost of $62.72 each, for a total investment of $250,558.
