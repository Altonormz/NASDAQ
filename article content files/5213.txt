(RTTNews) - Asian stock markets are trading mostly lower on Wednesday, following the broadly negative cues from global markets overnight, as traders reacted to US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell warned interest rates will likely remain higher for longer than previously expected to fight inflation. Asian markets closed mixed on Tuesday.
Citing stubbornly elevated inflation and stronger than expected economic data, Powell also said the Fed would be prepared to reaccelerate the pace of rate hikes and for a longer period if incoming data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted.
"The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy," Powell said. "We will stay the course until the job is done."
