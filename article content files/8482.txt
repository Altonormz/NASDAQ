In trading on Tuesday, shares of the The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (Symbol: XLU) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $65.27 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, the RSI reading has hit 29.0 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 43.6.

A bullish investor could look at XLU's 29.0 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), XLU's low point in its 52 week range is $60.35 per share, with $78.22 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $65.61.  The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund shares are currently trading down about 0.9% on the day.
