In trading on Thursday, shares of the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (Symbol: KBE) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $44.16 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR S&P Bank, the RSI reading has hit 27.6 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 48.2.

A bullish investor could look at KBE's 27.6 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), KBE's low point in its 52 week range is $42.57 per share, with $55.50 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $44.30.  SPDR S&P Bank shares are currently trading off about 3.7% on the day.
