(RTTNews) - French stocks rose on Friday to extend gains from the previous session after a survey showed business activity at French service providers expanded in February for the first time since October last year.
Sentiment was also underpinned after a Fed official suggested a measured approach to raising interest rates and a private survey showed China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace in six months in February. 
The benchmark CAC 40 was up 38 points, or half a percent, at 7,320 after climbing 0.7 percent on Thursday.
Among the top gainers, BNP Paribas, Capgemini, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Veolia, Engie, ArcelorMittal, Renault and STMicroelectronics jumped 1-2 percent.
