In trading on Tuesday, shares of the FUTY ETF (Symbol: FUTY) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $42.47 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of FUTY, the RSI reading has hit 29.4 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 43.6.

A bullish investor could look at FUTY's 29.4 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), FUTY's low point in its 52 week range is $39.1401 per share, with $50.25 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $42.67.  FUTY shares are currently trading off about 0.9% on the day.
