(RTTNews) - The major European stock markets finished firmly lower on Friday, unable to hold early gains and sinking firmly into the red.
The early support came on optimism for U.S. inflation data later in the day, but those hopes were crushed when the report showed that core inflation unexpectedly accelerated.
That higher inflation has added to recent concerns about the outlook for interest rates as the Federal Reserve may now have to move its policy rate higher and for longer.
