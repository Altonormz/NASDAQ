In trading on Thursday, shares of the SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond ETF (Symbol: BWX) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $21.96 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond, the RSI reading has hit 29.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 39.9.

A bullish investor could look at BWX's 29.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), BWX's low point in its 52 week range is $20.10 per share, with $26.98 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $21.97.  SPDR Bloomberg International Treasury Bond shares are currently trading off about 0.6% on the day.
