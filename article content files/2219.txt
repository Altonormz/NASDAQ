(RTTNews) - Apollo Global Management Inc. (APO) has agreed to acquire chemical company Univar Solutions Inc. (UNVR) for $8.1 billion including debt, the Wall Street Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter.
In Tuesday pre-market trade, UNVR was trading at $35.44 up $4.27 or 13.70%.
The deal is expected to be unveiled Tuesday.
In early January, German chemicals distributor Brenntag (BNTGF.PK) said it terminated its preliminary buy-out discussions with Univar Solutions. But Univar then said it would continue discussions relating to other indications of interest that have been received with respect to a potential transaction.
