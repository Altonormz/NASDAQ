In trading on Friday, shares of the FREL ETF (Symbol: FREL) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $23.98 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of FREL, the RSI reading has hit 29.6 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 43.4.

A bullish investor could look at FREL's 29.6 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), FREL's low point in its 52 week range is $22.29 per share, with $33.84 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $24.04.  FREL shares are currently trading off about 3% on the day.
