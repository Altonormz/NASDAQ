There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on January 20, Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc's Director, Joseph C. Galante, invested $72,260.00 into 1,000 shares of PNFP, for a cost per share of $72.26.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Thursday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc (Symbol: PNFP) and achieve a cost basis 1.2% cheaper than Galante, with shares changing hands as low as $71.42 per share.  It should be noted that Galante has collected $0.22/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 0.9% on their purchase from a total return basis.  Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc shares are currently trading off about 2.6% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of PNFP shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, PNFP's low point in its 52 week range is $67.86 per share, with $100.73 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $71.94.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which PNFP insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
