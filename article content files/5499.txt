At Holdings Channel, we have reviewed 6,892 13F filings for the 12/31/2022 reporting period, and looked at the various S&P 500 components held by each of these reporting hedge funds and other 13F filers.  For each component, we totaled the number of shares held across all of these funds.  Next, we went back to the 09/30/2022 period, and went through the same exercise for each of those 6,892 funds.  By comparing the same group across the two periods, we can see which S&P 500 components, in the aggregate, these particular funds have been buying and selling.


	
One of the components that stands out with notable buying, is Meta Platforms Inc (Symbol: META).  We should point out before going any further, that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions.  A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position.  This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.  

	
However, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be an interesting exercise, especially when comparing one holding period to another.  So, let's take a look at the change in META positions across that group of 6,892 funds we have looked at that have filed for the 12/31/2022 period, versus back at their 09/30/2022 report.  We found that between these two periods, 
funds increased their holdings by 1,598,641,905 shares in the aggregate, from 25,570,875 up to 1,624,212,780 for a share count increase of approximately 6251.81%. 
		
The overall top three funds holding META on 12/31/2022 were:

		



		We'll keep following the latest 13F filings by fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods.  While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Meta Platforms Inc (Symbol: META).
