There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 1, Genesis Energy L.P.'s Senior Vice President, Ryan S. Sims, invested $19,975.00 into 1,700 shares of GEL, for a cost per share of $11.75.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Wednesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Genesis Energy L.P. (Symbol: GEL) and achieve a cost basis even cheaper than Sims, with shares changing hands as low as $11.74 per share.  Genesis Energy L.P. shares are currently trading down about 0.8% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of GEL shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, GEL's low point in its 52 week range is $7.61 per share, with $13.34 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $11.81.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which GEL insider buying was recorded over the last six months:
