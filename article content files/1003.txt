In trading on Thursday, shares of the Vanguard Materials ETF (Symbol: VAW) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $165.27 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Materials, the RSI reading has hit 29.96 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.8.

A bullish investor could look at VAW's 29.96 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), VAW's low point in its 52 week range is $146.72 per share, with $201.11 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $165.95.  Vanguard Materials shares are currently trading down about 1.1% on the day.
