In trading on Thursday, shares of the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF (Symbol: SPYD) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $38.53 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend, the RSI reading has hit 29.97 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.2.

A bullish investor could look at SPYD's 29.97 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), SPYD's low point in its 52 week range is $34.79 per share, with $45.83 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $38.70.  SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend shares are currently trading off about 2.3% on the day.
