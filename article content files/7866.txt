In trading on Wednesday, shares of the Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (Symbol: VCSH) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $74.90 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond, the RSI reading has hit 27.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.4.

A bullish investor could look at VCSH's 27.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), VCSH's low point in its 52 week range is $73.26 per share, with $79.59 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $74.92.  Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond shares are currently trading off about 0.5% on the day.
