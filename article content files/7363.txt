In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 6.26% for Mativ Inc, 6.75% for Kronos Worldwide Inc, and 0.80% for Alcoa Corporation.  



In Thursday trading, Mativ Inc shares are currently off about 1.8%, Kronos Worldwide Inc shares are down about 1.4%, and Alcoa Corporation shares are down about 3.1% on the day.
