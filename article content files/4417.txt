There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on January 27, City Holding Co.'s Director, Gregory A. Burton, invested $22,872.68 into 250 shares of CHCO, for a cost per share of $91.49.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Thursday, bargain hunters could buy shares of City Holding Co. (Symbol: CHCO) and achieve a cost basis 1.0% cheaper than Burton, with shares changing hands as low as $90.56 per share.  City Holding Co. shares are currently trading off about 4.1% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of CHCO shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, CHCO's low point in its 52 week range is $73.40 per share, with $103 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $90.86.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which CHCO insider buying was recorded over the last six months:




The current annualized dividend paid by City Holding Co. is $2.6/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/12/2023.
