In this short update, let’s go over a few brief points of emphasis for the markets right now.
Looking at the global markets, international equities continue to rank higher than most U.S. sectors on a risk-adjusted basis. That being said, the U.S. markets are not favoring more traditionally “defensive” industries. Canterbury’s risk adjusted rankings show that Industrials, Basic Materials, Financials, and Information Technology are the top 4 S&P 500 sectors, while those traditionally “defensive” sectors like Utilities, Staples and Health Care are at the bottom of the sector rankings. 
The Nasdaq index is primarily composed of technology-related securities. These same stocks play a large role in the movement of the S&P 500, due to their large market capitalization. Because of their large market share within the index, technology stocks and the Nasdaq have tended to lead during market rallies and lag during declines. With the markets recent, slight pullback from its latest high, one positive is that the Nasdaq index has not lagged. In fact, its relative strength to the S&P 500 since the market’s peak in early February has been flat.
In the chart below, you can see that the Nasdaq is attempting to test its 200-day moving average for support. Last Friday, the Nasdaq rose off of its 200-day moving average (point 1).The lower portion of the chart shows the Nasdaq’s relative strength to the S&P 500. While the Nasdaq has previously underperformed during market declines (point 2) and outperformed during rallies (point 3), the Nasdaq’s relative strength been flat during the market’s recent pullback (point 4).    
Right now, many major indexes, like the S&P 500 are at a point of support. The market index is currently sitting at the intersection of some trend lines and its 200-day moving average. Last Friday, a few of these indexes made a move higher in attempt to confirm support. Although this was a short-term move, it is a step in the right direction to forming another higher low. We will see if that trend can continue.
Regardless, Canterbury continues to monitor and make changes to portfolio allocations as market conditions rotate and change. Canterbury’s Portfolio Thermostat maintains a diversified portfolio of securities that create an “effectively” diversified portfolio to limit fluctuations. The goal is to maintain consistent portfolio volatility regardless of the overall market environment- bull or bear.
