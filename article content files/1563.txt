In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (Symbol: EUFN) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $17.11 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares MSCI Europe Financials, the RSI reading has hit 27.1 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 37.9.

A bullish investor could look at EUFN's 27.1 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), EUFN's low point in its 52 week range is $13.54 per share, with $20.27 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $17.48.  iShares MSCI Europe Financials shares are currently trading down about 6.4% on the day.
