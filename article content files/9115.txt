Asia-Pacific equity markets finished the day down across the board: Japan’s Nikkei declined 0.11%, China’s Shanghai Composite0.28%, India’s SENSEX 0.30%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng 0.33%, South Korea’s KOSPI 0.87%, and Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries 1.24% on a broad decline led Electronic Technology and Industrial Services names. Taiwan’s equity markets are closed today and tomorrow to mark Peace Day, sometimes known as “228.” This is a day of remembrance of those who were killed in the February 28, 1947 anti-government uprising. By mid-day trading, European equity indices are up across the board, and U.S. futures point to a positive open.
As we wind down February, the market’s level of certainty regarding the Fed’s response to the macro-economic picture, especially inflation went from fairly high to “wait, Fed governors said what?” -- this comes along with research that argues that the economy needs a recession to fight inflation. Friday saw the worst trading day so far this year and while Fed Funds futures are still pricing in a 74% chance of a 25 basis point move following the March 22 meeting, that level of confidence has fallen from 84% a month ago. That sag reflected the recent string of data indicating inflation pressures are more persistent than previously thought. The market now sees a stream of 25 basis point hikes through mid-2023 but continues to show a potential rate cut in December.
We can infer the market is once again balancing the Fed’s need to return inflation to its targeted levels vs. that process’s potential impact on the economy. Based on the February PMI data published later this week, we could see those expectations shift further. We could also see calls for the Fed to take more aggressive action in the near term to return inflation to a downward trajectory. As you can see, mixed signals between trailing economic data and forward-looking market expectations are becoming increasingly difficult to reconcile.
International Economy
The economic sentiment indicator in the Euro Area slipped to 99.7 in February vs. 99.8 in January, missing the 101 market forecast. Sentiment weakened among manufacturers (0.5 vs 1.2 in January) and service providers (9.5 vs 10.4) but improved among traders (-0.1 vs -0.7), consumers (-19 vs -20.7), and constructors (1.8 vs 1.4). The Euro Area consumer confidence indicator was confirmed at -19 for February, the highest since February 2022. Leading the continued MoM improvement were improving inflation expectations as the energy crises eased thanks to milder than expected weather and the region’s prospects for avoiding a recession this year.
