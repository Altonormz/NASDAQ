In trading on Thursday, shares of the Invesco KBW Bank ETF (Symbol: KBWB) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $51.29 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Invesco KBW Bank, the RSI reading has hit 26.3 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 48.2.

A bullish investor could look at KBWB's 26.3 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), KBWB's low point in its 52 week range is $47.50 per share, with $68.46 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $51.55.  Invesco KBW Bank shares are currently trading off about 3.7% on the day.
