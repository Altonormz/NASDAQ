(RTTNews) - As another month draws to a close, it is time to reflect on recent regulatory developments that have made headlines and look ahead to what's in store in March, which is observed as the National Kidney Month.
GlaxoSmithKline's Jesduvroq was approved by the FDA on February 1, becoming the first oral treatment for anemia caused by chronic kidney disease for adults on dialysis.
In order to help address the significant increase in plant-based milk alternative products that have become available in the marketplace over the past decade, the U.S. regulatory agency, on Feb.22, issued draft labeling recommendations. The draft guidance also recommends voluntary nutrient statements for the labeling of some plant-based milk alternatives.
On February 24, the FDA issued emergency use authorisation for Lucira COVID-19 & Flu Home Test, a single-use at-home test kit that provides results from self-collected nasal swab samples in roughly 30 minutes. This marks the first over-the-counter (OTC) at-home diagnostic test that can differentiate and detect both influenza A and B (commonly referred to as the flu) and SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for causing COVID-19.
Let's now take a look at some of the biotech stocks that are awaiting FDA decisions in March.
