In trading on Wednesday, shares of the Vanguard Energy ETF (Symbol: VDE) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $107.5157 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Energy, the RSI reading has hit 28.1 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 37.9.

A bullish investor could look at VDE's 28.1 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), VDE's low point in its 52 week range is $90.87 per share, with $132.625 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $108.20.  Vanguard Energy shares are currently trading off about 4% on the day.
