In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ETF (Symbol: GSG) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $18.65 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust, the RSI reading has hit 29.6 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.5.

A bullish investor could look at GSG's 29.6 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), GSG's low point in its 52 week range is $18.65 per share, with $26.49 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $19.07.  iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust shares are currently trading off about 2.6% on the day.
