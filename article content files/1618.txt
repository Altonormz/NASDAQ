In trading on Wednesday, shares of the FNDE ETF (Symbol: FNDE) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $24.83 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of FNDE, the RSI reading has hit 27.2 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 37.9.

A bullish investor could look at FNDE's 27.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), FNDE's low point in its 52 week range is $22.97 per share, with $29.72 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $24.81.  FNDE shares are currently trading down about 1.9% on the day.
