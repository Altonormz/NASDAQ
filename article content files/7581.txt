EBITDA margin was 15.6 percent, down from 16.4 percent a year ago.
Sales from continuing operations were 5.198 billion francs, compared to 4.372 billion francs in 2021. This corresponds to an increase of 24 percent in local currency and 19 percent in Swiss francs.
In the fourth quarter, sales were 1.323 billion francs, an increase of 12 percent in local currency and 7 percent in Swiss francs from last year. EBITDA decreased 24 percent to 154 million francs, and the corresponding margin fell to 11. 6 percent from 14.7 percent a year earlier.
Further, the Board of Directors recommends an increased regular distribution of 0. 42 franc per share to the Annual General Meeting on April 4.
