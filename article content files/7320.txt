In trading on Thursday, shares of the BOND ETF (Symbol: BOND) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $90.26 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of BOND, the RSI reading has hit 28.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 39.9.

A bullish investor could look at BOND's 28.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), BOND's low point in its 52 week range is $86.608 per share, with $105.555 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $90.33.  BOND shares are currently trading off about 0.4% on the day.
