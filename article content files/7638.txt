In trading on Wednesday, shares of the LDUR ETF (Symbol: LDUR) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $93.75 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of LDUR, the RSI reading has hit 29.1 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.1.

A bullish investor could look at LDUR's 29.1 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), LDUR's low point in its 52 week range is $93.13 per share, with $99.3177 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $93.83.  LDUR shares are currently trading off about 0.4% on the day.
