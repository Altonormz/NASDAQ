There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on November 7, Virtu Financial Inc - Class A's Director, Joanne Minieri, invested $90,512.40 into 4,000 shares of VIRT, for a cost per share of $22.63.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Monday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Virtu Financial Inc - Class A (Symbol: VIRT) and achieve a cost basis 15.0% cheaper than Minieri, with shares changing hands as low as $19.24 per share.  It should be noted that Minieri has collected $0.24/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently down 13.9% on their purchase from a total return basis.  Virtu Financial Inc - Class A shares are currently trading up about 0.9% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of VIRT shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
