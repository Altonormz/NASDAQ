In trading on Friday, shares of the SPDR ICE Preferred Securities ETF (Symbol: PSK) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $33.65 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR ICE Preferred Securities, the RSI reading has hit 28.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 38.3.

A bullish investor could look at PSK's 28.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), PSK's low point in its 52 week range is $32.02 per share, with $39.04 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $34.09.  SPDR ICE Preferred Securities shares are currently trading down about 1.4% on the day.
