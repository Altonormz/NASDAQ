While January saw stocks rally sharply on easing Fed expectations, February painted a different picture. The month kicked off with the Federal Reserve raising the benchmark rate 25bps to 4.75% (upper bound), with another 25bps hike expected in both March and May. The market had been pricing in rate cuts in the back half of the year, but those expectations have largely disappeared with the assumption now that the Fed will keep rates higher for longer. The terminal rate has risen to ~5.4%. 
Part of the move higher in rate expectations was the hot jobs number as Change in Nonfarm Payrolls came in +517k, substantially higher than the expected 189k. Change in average hourly earnings remained above 4.4% YoY, with Leisure and Hospitality seeing the largest gains at 7.0%. Following the hot jobs print, inflation data was mostly in line with expectations in terms of MoM readings, although services inflation remained elevated. Housing prices continued to cool as mortgage rates jumped higher, while commodities continued their move lower. January CPI MoM was in line with expectations of 0.5%, while YoY came in at 6.4%, above expectations of 6.2%. Furthermore, January PPI data came in hotter than expected, reporting a MoM increase of 0.7% versus 0.4% expected and a YoY increase of 6.0%, above the expected 5.4%. Finally, the headline PCE data came in hotter as well, reporting an increase of 0.6% MoM vs. 0.5% estimate and 5.4% vs. 5.0% on a YoY basis. 
Outside of the economic data and FOMC rate decision, February also saw the second half of 4Q ’22 earnings prints. The market rewarded positive EPS surprises more than average while punishing negative surprises much less than average. According to FactSet, companies reporting positive EPS surprises have seen a price increase of 1.1% in the two days leading up to and two days following the print, which is above the 5-year average of 0.9%. On the flip side, negative surprises have resulted in a decrease of 0.6% compared to the 5-year average of -2.2%. 
On a total return basis, large-cap growth stocks were the top performers for the month, with the Nasdaq 100 falling only 0.4%, while the Russell 1000 Growth index slid 1.2%. Large-cap value stocks were the hardest hit as the Russell 1000 Value index fell 3.5%, followed by the Russell Microcap index falling 2.9%. At the sector level, Energy stocks were a clear underperformer falling 7.1%, followed by REITs and Utilities, which slid 6.2% and 5.9%, respectively. The technology sector was the only positive on the month as it climbed 0.4%.

With 96% of S&P 500 companies reporting Q4 earnings, the results have been subpar.

There are certainly several key events to keep an eye on in March, including the FOMC decision on the 22nd. The market is currently expecting another 25bp rate hike from the committee, but recent Fed minutes showed that some members were in favor of a 50bp hike during the February meeting. In the days leading up to the meeting, we will see the Nonfarm Payrolls number on the 10th, which surprised to the upside in February, followed by the ever-important CPI release on the 14th. Stocks sold off in the month as bond yields rose, so the bond market will continue to have a say in equity valuations. While no longer front and center, the continuing war in Ukraine remains a constant threat to markets, with tensions escalating. Furthermore, the recent downing of the Chinese “spy balloon” eroded relations between the two countries, and any further issues between the world’s two largest economies could impact trade at a high level.
