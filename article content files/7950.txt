There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on January 30, WesBanco Inc's Director, Kerry M. Stemler, invested $36,161.60 into 1,000 shares of WSBC, for a cost per share of $36.16.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Wednesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of WesBanco Inc (Symbol: WSBC) and achieve a cost basis 1.0% cheaper than Stemler, with shares changing hands as low as $35.80 per share.  WesBanco Inc shares are currently trading down about 1% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of WSBC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:
