In trading on Monday, shares of the SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap ETF (Symbol: SPMD) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $41.7599 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap, the RSI reading has hit 26.0 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at SPMD's 26.0 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), SPMD's low point in its 52 week range is $38.21 per share, with $48.67 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $42.17.  SPDR Portfolio S&P 400 Mid Cap shares are currently trading off about 2.4% on the day.
