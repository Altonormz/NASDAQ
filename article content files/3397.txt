In trading on Friday, shares of the Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF (Symbol: MGV) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $98.01 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Vanguard Mega Cap Value, the RSI reading has hit 28.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 36.1.

A bullish investor could look at MGV's 28.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), MGV's low point in its 52 week range is $89.38 per share, with $109.92 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $98.38.  Vanguard Mega Cap Value shares are currently trading down about 0.8% on the day.
