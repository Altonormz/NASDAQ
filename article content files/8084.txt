(RTTNews) - Medical imaging, which is also referred to as diagnostic imaging, involves the utilization of electromagnetic radiation and other techniques to provide insight into the body's internal structures, assisting in identifying the root cause of an ailment or injury and validating a diagnosis.
According to a report by the market research firm IndustryARC, the global Diagnostic Imaging Services Market is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.1% during the forecast period of 2022-2027, with an estimated market size of $732 billion by 2027.

The company has also made significant investments in Artificial Intelligence solutions through three AI acquisitions namely DeepHealth (acquired in Apr.2020), Aidence (Jan.2022) and Quantib (Jan.2022).
The AI segment aims to explore opportunities in cancer screening, with a focus on the four most prevalent cancers of Breast, Prostate, Lung and Colon.
