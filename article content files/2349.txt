(RTTNews) - The Japanese stock market is sharply lower on Tuesday, extending the losses in the previous two sessions, with the Nikkei 225 falling below the 27,200 level, following the mixed cues from Wall Street overnight, with banking stocks tumbling amid fears that a U.S. banking debacle may follow last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, even though banking regulators have allayed all such fears.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is down 641.59 points or 2.31 percent at 27,191.37, after hitting a low of 27,104.75 earlier. Japanese shares ended significantly lower on Monday.

On the Wall Street, stocks recovered after an early setback on Monday and ended on a mixed note, but shares from the technology space outperformed, spending much of the day's session in positive territory.
