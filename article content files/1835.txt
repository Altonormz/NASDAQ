Pour out a Slurpee in memory of the man who allowed it to exist.
Masatoshi Ito, the Japanese billionaire responsible for transforming 7-Eleven into a global convenience store powerhouse died last week at the age of 98, the company confirmed.
Ito was born with retail in his blood as his parents, Senzo and Yuki, ran a dry goods and clothing shop where he worked before and after serving in the Japanese military. He later founded the grocery and department store chain Ito-Yokado.
After multiple visits to America, Ito embraced the consumerism and franchising the US is known for and decided he wanted to bring American retail to Japan. That mindset and a successful gamble paved the way for Ito's biggest move: establishing the country's first 7-Eleven in 1973:
Shady Moves: Ito does have some blemishes on his record, though. In 1992, the Tokyo Stock Exchange honored Ito as a model corporate citizen. Funnily enough, just a month later, Ito was accused of paying off sokaiya, which are kind of like activist investors by way of the Yakuza. Nevertheless, he remained an influential force at Seven & I and in 2005 helped the company acquire the rest of 7-Eleven.
