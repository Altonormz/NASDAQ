In trading on Wednesday, shares of the Invesco BulletShares 2026 Corporate Bond ETF (Symbol: BSCQ) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $18.7104 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Invesco BulletShares 2026 Corporate Bond, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 46.4.

A bullish investor could look at BSCQ's 29.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), BSCQ's low point in its 52 week range is $18.37 per share, with $20.25 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $18.71.  Invesco BulletShares 2026 Corporate Bond shares are currently trading off about 0.2% on the day.
