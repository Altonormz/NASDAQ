In trading on Tuesday, shares of the Uranium ETF (Symbol: URA) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $19.315 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Uranium, the RSI reading has hit 28.8 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 38.3.

A bullish investor could look at URA's 28.8 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), URA's low point in its 52 week range is $17.65 per share, with $28.49 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $19.39.  Uranium shares are currently trading off about 1.5% on the day.
