In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.07% for NVIDIA Corp, 2.10% for Southwest Airlines Co, and 2.88% for Walker & Dunlop Inc.  



		


In Friday trading, NVIDIA Corp shares are currently down about 0.2%, Southwest Airlines Co shares are up about 0.8%, and Walker & Dunlop Inc shares are up about 0.5% on the day.
