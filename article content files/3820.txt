In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.  Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.98% for UGI Corp., 3.04% for Ameren Corp, and 3.23% for Xcel Energy Inc.  



In Friday trading, UGI Corp. shares are currently off about 0.1%, Ameren Corp shares are up about 0.2%, and Xcel Energy Inc shares are up about 0.3% on the day.
