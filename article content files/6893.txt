Earnings per share were 0.26 euro, compared to loss of 0.45 euro a year ago.
Adjusted EBIT was 575 million euros, compared to last year's loss of 42 million euros.
Lufthansa revenue for the quarter climbed 52 percent to 8.88 billion euros from last year's 5.83 billion euros due to the strong increase in demand for air travel.
