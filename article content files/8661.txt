Asia-Pacific equity markets finished the day mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.79%, and India’s SENSEX declined 0.55%, while Japan’s Nikkei ended the day essentially flat, up 0.08%. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.42%, Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries gained 0.52%, and China’s Shanghai Composite closed 0.66% higher following a mostly positive day in the U.S. yesterday. Taiwan’s equities markets are closed today marking the “228 Uprising” and subsequent actions that quashed it. By mid-day trading, major European equity indices are up, and U.S. futures point to a higher open.
As we look to close the book on February when equity markets finish trading today, equities are on track to give back a portion of their January gains. As we’ve been discussing with readers, the catalysts have been the renewed focus on inflation and the Fed vs. Treasury yields, the stock market’s P/E valuation, and questions about the speed of the economy. Data from Citigroup points to traders taking a more bearish stance as they added nearly $3 billion of new shorts to S&P 500 futures last week.
With tomorrow’s start of the new month, we will begin another cycle of economic data releases. In the wake of January's data, which pointed to a stronger-than-expected economy, February's reports have the potential to reshape expectations not only about the vector and velocity of the economy but also inflation and of course, the Fed’s response to both.
International Economy
Retail sales in Japan rose by 6.3% YoY in January, topping market forecasts of 4.0% and accelerating from 3.8% growth a month earlier.

Industrial Production in Japan decreased 3.10% YoY in January. Industries that mainly contributed to the decline were motor vehicles, production machinery, and electronic parts & devices.
