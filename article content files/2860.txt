There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on March 6, Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated's Director, James Joseph Kilroy IV, invested $192,700.00 into 10,000 shares of HR, for a cost per share of $19.27.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Monday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated (Symbol: HR) and achieve a cost basis 5.2% cheaper than Kilroy IV, with shares changing hands as low as $18.26 per share.
