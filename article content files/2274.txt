In trading on Monday, shares of the SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities ETF (Symbol: CWB) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $64.45 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities, the RSI reading has hit 29.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 36.1.

A bullish investor could look at CWB's 29.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), CWB's low point in its 52 week range is $62.22 per share, with $78.09 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $65.20.  SPDR Bloomberg Convertible Securities shares are currently trading off about 0.9% on the day.
