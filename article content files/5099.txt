(RTTNews) - Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc. (SWX) announced Wednesday that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 3.58 million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $60.12 per share, for net proceeds, after the underwriting discount and before the estimated expenses of the offering payable by the Company, of approximately $207.7 million.
The offering is expected to close on March 10, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. The Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 536,427 shares of common stock.
