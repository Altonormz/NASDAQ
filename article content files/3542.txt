In trading on Friday, shares of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (Symbol: XBI) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $75.92 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR S&P Biotech, the RSI reading has hit 27.0 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 38.3.

A bullish investor could look at XBI's 27.0 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), XBI's low point in its 52 week range is $61.78 per share, with $97.19 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $76.63.  SPDR S&P Biotech shares are currently trading off about 2.9% on the day.
