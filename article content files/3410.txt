In trading on Friday, shares of the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF (Symbol: IWS) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $103.43 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value, the RSI reading has hit 28.3 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 36.1.

A bullish investor could look at IWS's 28.3 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IWS's low point in its 52 week range is $94.32 per share, with $122.68 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $104.15.  iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value shares are currently trading off about 2.5% on the day.
