In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (Symbol: IYH) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $265.9168 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares U.S. Healthcare, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.4.

A bullish investor could look at IYH's 29.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IYH's low point in its 52 week range is $247.38 per share, with $301.63 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $266.64.  iShares U.S. Healthcare shares are currently trading off about 0.2% on the day.
