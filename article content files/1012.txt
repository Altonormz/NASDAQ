In trading on Thursday, shares of the AVDE ETF (Symbol: AVDE) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $53.30 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of AVDE, the RSI reading has hit 29.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.8.

A bullish investor could look at AVDE's 29.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), AVDE's low point in its 52 week range is $44.63 per share, with $61.62 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $53.36.  AVDE shares are currently trading down about 0.8% on the day.
