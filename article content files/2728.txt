In trading on Monday, shares of the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund ETF (Symbol: DLN) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $58.90 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund, the RSI reading has hit 29.2 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at DLN's 29.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), DLN's low point in its 52 week range is $54.81 per share, with $67.44 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $59.65.  WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund shares are currently trading down about 0.5% on the day.
