The global forecast for the Asian markets is negative, with profit taking expected amid concerns over the outlook for interest rates. The European and U.S. markets were down and the Asian bourses are tipped to follow suit.
The Hang Seng finished modestly lower on Tuesday following losses from the financials, oil companies and technology stocks, while the properties were mixed.
For the day, the index sank 157.57 points or 0.79 percent to finish at 19,785.94 after trading between 19,783.07 and 20,185.05.
