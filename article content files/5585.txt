(RTTNews) - Early trading on Wall Street on Tuesday is likely to be driven by reaction to congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
Ahead of Powell's remarks, the major index futures are currently pointing to a slightly higher open for the markets, with the S&P 500 futures up by 0.1 percent.
Powell is scheduled to deliver his semiannual monetary policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee beginning at 10 am ET.
The Fed chief's prepared remarks are likely to be released ahead of his testimony and could have a significant impact on early trading.
Traders are likely to pay close attention to Powell's remarks, looking for additional clues about the outlook for interest rates.
"Everyone is expecting Fed Chair Powell to deliver his best hits of 'we have more work to do' and 'higher for longer," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.
He added, "Powell might not commit how much higher rates will go, but he will keep the door open for the Fed's dot plots to move higher."
Not long after the start of trading, the Commerce Department is due to release its report on wholesale inventories in the month of January. Wholesale inventories are expected to decrease by 0.4 percent.
