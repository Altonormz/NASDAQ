In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares Global Energy ETF (Symbol: IXC) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $35.31 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares Global Energy, the RSI reading has hit 27.0 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 37.9.

A bullish investor could look at IXC's 27.0 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IXC's low point in its 52 week range is $30.53 per share, with $42.98 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $35.53.  iShares Global Energy shares are currently trading down about 4.5% on the day.
