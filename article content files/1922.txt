The directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when directors make major buys, investors are wise to take notice.  Presumably the only reason a director of a company would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.  So in this series we look at the largest insider buys by company directors over the trailing six month period, one of which was a total of $1.2M invested across 2 purchases by Ronald J. Kruszewski, Chief Executive Officer at Stifel Financial Corporation (Symbol: SF).
	



Kruszewski's average cost works out to $57.76/share. In trading on Tuesday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Stifel Financial Corporation (Symbol: SF) and achieve a cost basis lower than Kruszewski, with shares changing hands as low as $56.89 per share.  Shares of Stifel Financial Corporation were changing hands at $58.49 at last check, trading up about 6% on Tuesday.
