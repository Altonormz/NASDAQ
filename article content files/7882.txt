In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (Symbol: IGSB) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $49.65 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond, the RSI reading has hit 29.1 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.4.

A bullish investor could look at IGSB's 29.1 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IGSB's low point in its 52 week range is $48.62 per share, with $52.72 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $49.67.  iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond shares are currently trading off about 0.5% on the day.
