In trading on Friday, shares of the Invesco Solar ETF (Symbol: TAN) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $69.37 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Invesco Solar, the RSI reading has hit 29.8 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 43.4.

A bullish investor could look at TAN's 29.8 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), TAN's low point in its 52 week range is $55.54 per share, with $91.12 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $69.55.  Invesco Solar shares are currently trading off about 3.5% on the day.
