Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time.  This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue.  If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.44% for Wingstop Inc, 2.08% for Primo Water Corp, and 1.52% for Acushnet Holdings Corp.
