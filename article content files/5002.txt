Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 3/10/23, Tri Continental Corporation (Symbol: TY) will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.29, payable on 3/21/23.  As a percentage of TY's recent stock price of $26.90, this dividend works out to approximately 1.08%, so look for shares of Tri Continental Corporation to trade 1.08% lower — all else being equal — when TY shares open for trading on 3/10/23.













In general, dividends are not always predictable; but looking at the history above can help in judging whether the most recent dividend from TY is likely to continue, and whether the current estimated yield of 4.31% on annualized basis is a reasonable expectation of annual yield going forward.
