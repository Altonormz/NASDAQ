In trading on Friday, shares of the WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund ETF (Symbol: DON) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $40.87 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund, the RSI reading has hit 29.9 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 38.3.

A bullish investor could look at DON's 29.9 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), DON's low point in its 52 week range is $37.4669 per share, with $45.77 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $41.15.  WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund shares are currently trading down about 1.5% on the day.
