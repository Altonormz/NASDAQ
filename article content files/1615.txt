In trading on Wednesday, shares of the iShares U.S. Energy ETF (Symbol: IYE) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $41.20 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares U.S. Energy, the RSI reading has hit 28.3 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 37.9.

A bullish investor could look at IYE's 28.3 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IYE's low point in its 52 week range is $34.94 per share, with $50.747 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $41.48.  iShares U.S. Energy shares are currently trading down about 3.7% on the day.
