In trading on Thursday, shares of the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (Symbol: IYF) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $73.89 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of iShares U.S. Financials, the RSI reading has hit 24.5 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.2.

A bullish investor could look at IYF's 24.5 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), IYF's low point in its 52 week range is $66.04 per share, with $88 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $74.29.  iShares U.S. Financials shares are currently trading down about 4.3% on the day.
