Earnings per share went up 8.8 percent to 7.65 euros from 7.03 euros a year ago. Earnings per share pre came in at 10.05 euros, compared to previous year's 8.72 euros.
EBITDA pre rose 12.2 percent on a reported basis and 6.1 percent organically to 6.85 billion euros. Meanwhile, EBITDA pre margin fell to 30.8 percent from prior year's 31 percent.
Group net sales increased 13 percent to 22.23 billion euros from last year's 19.69 billion euros, driven by all regions and business sectors, particularly Life Science.
