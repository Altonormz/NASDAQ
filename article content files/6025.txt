Today’s Big Picture
Asia-Pacific equity markets finished the day up across the board except for China’s Shanghai Composite, which fell 0.19%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.17%, Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries rose 0.58%, India’s SENSEX gained 0.69%, Taiwan’s TAIEX and Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.99% and 1.11% higher, respectively. South Korea’s KOSPI set the pace, up 1.26% led by Commercial Services and Electronic Technology names. By mid-day trading, major European equity indices are up across the board, and U.S. futures point to a mixed-to-down open.
With China’s issuing a smaller-than-expected 2023 GDP growth target, we could see some air let out of stocks this morning as we start what will be a big week focused on the Fed as well as February job creation and wage inflation. With the bulk of that data coming after Fed Chair Powell gives his semi-annual testimony in Washington, a two-day event that begins tomorrow, we could be in for a volatile week should the market have to re-set its interest rate expectations. With the February Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index not due until the first half of next week, odds are the stock market will once again emulate the Fed and remain “data dependent” as it trades. With that in mind, as we move through the week, readers should be mindful of moves in the dollar, 10-year Treasury yields, and fed funds expectations measured by the CME FedWatch Tool. What they show will likely indicate how stocks will trade as the coming days unfold.
