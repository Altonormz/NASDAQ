There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.  Back on January 19, JPMorgan Chase & Co's Director, Mellody L. Hobson, invested $50,447.59 into 375 shares of JPM, for a cost per share of $134.53.  Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money.

In trading on Thursday, bargain hunters could buy shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (Symbol: JPM) and achieve a cost basis even cheaper than Hobson, with shares changing hands as low as $134.49 per share.  JPMorgan Chase & Co shares are currently trading down about 1.9% on the day.  The chart below shows the one year performance of JPM shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, JPM's low point in its 52 week range is $101.28 per share, with $144.34 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $135.19.  By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which JPM insider buying was recorded over the last six months:




The current annualized dividend paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co is $4/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 01/05/2023.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for JPM, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 2.9% annualized yield is likely to continue.
