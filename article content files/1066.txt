John Rotonti is the head of investor training and development at The Motley Fool, and this interview is part of our ongoing efforts to bring in outside speakers and panels to learn from the best and grow as investors.
In this March 14 session, we spoke with Richard Bernstein, who is the founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors (RBA). RBA is a research-driven, macro-focused investing firm with roughly $15 billion in assets under management. Prior to founding RBA in 2009, Bernstein was the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. He has been voted into Institutional Investor magazine's annual "All-America Research Team" 18 times, and has been inducted into the Institutional Investor "Hall of Fame." There are few people that have a more refined macro lens on equity investing than Bernstein.
