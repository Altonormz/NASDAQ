In trading on Wednesday, shares of the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF (Symbol: SPIB) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $31.694 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond, the RSI reading has hit 29.7 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 40.4.

A bullish investor could look at SPIB's 29.7 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), SPIB's low point in its 52 week range is $30.685 per share, with $35.04 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $31.70.  SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond shares are currently trading down about 0.7% on the day.
