In trading on Monday, shares of the SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap ETF (Symbol: SLY) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $81 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap, the RSI reading has hit 28.2 — by comparison, the RSI reading for the S&P 500 is currently 35.2.

A bullish investor could look at SLY's 28.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), SLY's low point in its 52 week range is $75.12 per share, with $96.80 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $81.52.  SPDR S&P 600 Small Cap shares are currently trading off about 2.4% on the day.
