When the game’s on the line, sometimes you need to call up your most experienced players, which segues into this discussion of blue-chip stocks to buy. Any sports fan realizes that age comes for every athlete, including the great Tom Brady. However, when the stakes run the highest, a certain confidence exists in putting the ball into the hands of veterans. So it is with blue chips.
Fundamentally, the top blue-chip stocks to buy underline high-quality enterprises. Specifically, investors can look at a company’s return on equity (ROE) relative to its industry standards. As Business Insider explains, a higher ROE “…signals that a company efficiently uses its shareholder’s equity to generate income.”
However, quality doesn’t mean much if the targeted security has little chance to move higher. Therefore, I’ve taken the time to source only enterprises that feature double-digit upside potential, per Wall Street analysts. So, without further ado, below are blue-chip stocks to buy for quality-focused investors.
