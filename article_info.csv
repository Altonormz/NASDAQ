By Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY, April 4 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said it had asked ANZ Group ANZ.AX to further justify the public benefits of its proposed A$4.9 billion ($3.32 billion) takeover of rival Suncorp's SUN.AX banking business ahead of a formal decision on the deal's future.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Tuesday asked both parties to submit more information before a final ruling is delivered by June 12.
ANZ, Australia's fourth-largest bank by market capitalisation, last July announced plans to buy the banking arm of the Queensland-based regional bank and insurance group Suncorp to help grow its mortgage book.
The deal requires ACCC approval and sign-off from the Queensland government and Australia's federal treasurer.
In a report published Tuesday, the ACCC said its preliminary view was the information it had was insufficient to substantiate the ""nature, likelihood and extent of the claimed public benefits, including ANZ's estimates of future synergies that will be achieved"".
ANZ said when the deal was announced buying Suncorp's banking arm would boost its mortgage book by A$47 billion to A$307 billion and help it reclaim market share lost to its main competitors.
""Any acquisition of a potential rival by one of the major banks must be closely considered,"" ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said in a statement separate to the report.
Australia's banking industry is dominated by four large banks, including ANZ.
Suncorp said in a statement that it would provide a comprehensive response to address the ACCC's concerns and the deal remained in the best interests of the company. Suncorp will become a pure insurance firm if the deal is completed.
ANZ did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

(RTTNews) - The Japanese stock market is modestly higher in choppy trading on Tuesday, extending the gains in the previous two sessions, with the Nikkei 225 moving above the 28,200 level, following the mixed cues from Wall Street overnight, with financial stocks gaining amid easing worries about global banking sector woes.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 Index is up 73.09 points or 0.26 percent at 28,261.24, after touching a high of 28,277.74 earlier. Japanese shares ended notably higher on Monday.
Market heavyweight SoftBank Group is edging up 0.2 percent, while Uniqlo operator Fast Retailing is flat. Among automakers, Honda is adding almost 1 percent, while Toyota is edging down 0.1 percent.
In the tech space, Advantest and Screen Holdings are edging down 0.1 to 0.4 percent each, while Tokyo Electron is gaining almost 1 percent.
In the banking sector, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial is edging down 0.1 percent, while Mizuho Financial is gaining more than 1 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial is adding almost 1 percent.
The major exporters are mixed. Canon and Mitsubishi Electric are flat, while Panasonic is edging down 0.4 percent. Sony is edging up 0.1 percent.
 
Among the other major gainers, Nintendo is gaining almost 3 percent.
Conversely, there are no other major losers.
In economic news, the monetary base in Japan was down 1.0 percent on year in March, the Bank of Japan said on Tuesday - coming in at 655.780 trillion yen. That follows the upwardly revised 1.6 percent contraction in February (originally -1.7 percent). The adjusted base was up 13.5 percent, slowing from 31.1 percent a month earlier. For the first quarter of 2023, the monetary base slipped 2.1 percent on year.
In the currency market, the U.S. dollar is trading in the higher 132 yen-range on Tuesday.
On the Wall Street, stocks ended higher on Monday with those from the energy sector rallying sharply after a surprise production cut announcement by the OPEC+ lifted crude oil prices.
Among the major averages, the Dow ended notably higher after staying firm right through the day's session. The S&P finished modestly higher after a choppy ride, while the Nasdaq trimmed its losses and settled well off the day's lows.
The Dow settled with a gain of 327.00 points or 0.98 percent at 33,601.15. The S&P 500 ended up 15.20 points or 0.37 percent at 4,124.51, while the Nasdaq ended lower by 32.45 points or 0.27 percent at 12,189.45.
Meanwhile, the major European markets also turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the German DAX Index drifted down 0.31 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 climbed 0.54 percent, and France's CAC 40 gained 0.32 percent.
Crude oil prices rose sharply on Monday, buoyed by the decision of OPEC+ oil producers to cut output by around 1.16 million barrels per day. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for May ended higher by $4.75 or 6.3 percent at $80.42 a barrel.

(RTTNews) - The Hong Kong stock market has climbed higher in five straight sessions, spiking more than 840 points or 4.4 percent along the way. The Hang Seng Index now sits just beneath the 20,410-point plateau although investors may lock in gains on Tuesday.
The global forecast for the Asian markets is a study in contrasts, with gains among oil stocks likely offset by weakness among the technology shares. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit.
The Hang Seng finished barely higher on Monday following gains from the energy stocks and mixed performances from the property and technology companies.
For the day, the index perked 9.07 points or 0.04 percent to finish at 20,409.18 after trading between 20,226.95 and 20,475.43.
Among the actives, Alibaba Group retreated 1.84 percent, while Alibaba Health Info jumped 1.94 percent, ANTA Sports stumbled 1.75 percent, China Life Insurance collected 0.31 percent, China Mengniu Dairy rose 0.47 percent, China Resources Land rallied 2.09 percent, CITIC sank 0.54 percent, CNOOC soared 2.40 percent, Country Garden advanced 0.74 percent, CSPC Pharmaceutical lost 0.52 percent, Galaxy Entertainment surged 5.91 percent, Hang Lung Properties and Hengan International Group both eased 0.14 percent, Henderson Land fell 0.37 percent, Hong Kong & China Gas dropped 0.87 percent, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China slumped 1.67 percent, JD.com skidded 1.34 percent, Lenovo slid 0.24 percent, Li Ning declined 1.94 percent, Meituan tanked 2.44 percent, New World Development gained 0.48 percent, Techtronic Industries spiked 2.24 percent, Xiaomi Corporation added 0.50 percent, WuXi Biologics tumbled 2.67 percent and CK Infrastructure and CLP Holdings were unchanged.
The lead from Wall Street is incongruous as the Dow and S&P opened higher and finished the same way, while the NASDAQ opened in the red and remained there throughout the session.
The Dow surged 327.00 points or 0.98 percent to finish at 33,601.15, while the NASDAQ dropped 32.45 points or 0.27 percent to end at 12,189.45 and the S&P 500 added 15.20 points or 0.37 percent to close at 4,124.51.
The strength on Wall Street rose the back of the energy sector as crude oil prices surged, while technology stocks ebbed on fears over the outlook for interest rates.
Oil prices rose sharply on Monday, buoyed by the decision of OPEC+ oil producers to cut output by around 1.16 million barrels per day. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for May ended higher by $4.75 or 6.3 percent at $80.42 a barrel.

6,Why Apple Stock Was Up 11% in March,,"April 03, 2023 — 09:16 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Jeremy Bowman,[],"April 03, 2023 — 09:16 pm EDT

The Motley Fool ->


Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) were moving higher last month as the tech giant trended with gains in the broader tech sector as tech stocks bounced back from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and fears of a recession seemed to cool off later in the month.
There was no single driver of the stock's gains in March, though it benefited from high-profile analyst upgrades, previews of its upcoming mixed-reality headset, and signs that it's continuing to focus on cost-cutting.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished March up 11%. As you can see from the chart below, the stock's gains tracked with the Nasdaq, but it rose more aggressively.

^IXIC data by YCharts.
Early in March, the company got a number of bullish analyst notes. JPMorgan said that iPhone demand is high compared to Apple's competitors, while Jefferies also found that demand was strong. 
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley boosted its price target from $175 to $180, reiterating an overweight rating and citing ""pent-up"" iPhone demand and a reacceleration in its services business. 
Shortly after that, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy rating and a price target of $199, noting the company's growing installed base of users. 
In the week of March 13, the stock started gaining again as tech stocks rebounded after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and reports confirmed that the company was planning to launch a mixed reality headset in 2023 as CEO Tim Cook pushed the company to release its device this year, according to Financial Times.
Bloomberg also reported that Apple was delaying some bonuses and expanding its hiring freeze, a sign it's expanding its cost-cutting efforts as it faces macroeconomic headwinds.
Among the big tech companies, Apple is the only one that has not announced major layoffs, but it's still a cyclical business. It can't escape the overarching in tech as recessionary threats have cooled off demand, and difficult comparisons have made growth numbers weak.
Towards the end of the month, the company also introduced its own buy-now-pay-later product, ""Apple Pay Later,"" extending the reach of its payments business.
To start April, Bloomberg reported that the company is cutting a small number of corporate retail positions, another reflection of cost-cutting, and UBS said that iPhone sell-through was down 3% in February year over year, an improvement from previous months, but still a decline.
Apple shares are expensive, but its gains last month show investors are willing to pay up for quality. Even in tough times, the company appears to be strengthening its competitive advantages and putting distance between itself and challengers like Samsung and Alphabet, which should help support its elevated valuation.

4,Australia regulator asks ANZ to justify benefits of $3.3 bln Suncorp deal,,"April 03, 2023 — 09:28 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Scott Murdoch,[],"April 03, 2023 — 09:28 pm EDT

Reuters ->


By Scott Murdoch
SYDNEY, April 4 (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said it had asked ANZ Group ANZ.AX to further justify the public benefits of its proposed A$4.9 billion ($3.32 billion) takeover of rival Suncorp's SUN.AX banking business ahead of a formal decision on the deal's future.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on Tuesday asked both parties to submit more information before a final ruling is delivered by June 12.
ANZ, Australia's fourth-largest bank by market capitalisation, last July announced plans to buy the banking arm of the Queensland-based regional bank and insurance group Suncorp to help grow its mortgage book.
The deal requires ACCC approval and sign-off from the Queensland government and Australia's federal treasurer.
In a report published Tuesday, the ACCC said its preliminary view was the information it had was insufficient to substantiate the ""nature, likelihood and extent of the claimed public benefits, including ANZ's estimates of future synergies that will be achieved"".
ANZ said when the deal was announced buying Suncorp's banking arm would boost its mortgage book by A$47 billion to A$307 billion and help it reclaim market share lost to its main competitors.
""Any acquisition of a potential rival by one of the major banks must be closely considered,"" ACCC deputy chair Mick Keogh said in a statement separate to the report.
Australia's banking industry is dominated by four large banks, including ANZ.
Suncorp said in a statement that it would provide a comprehensive response to address the ACCC's concerns and the deal remained in the best interests of the company. Suncorp will become a pure insurance firm if the deal is completed.
ANZ did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

6,Why Apple Stock Was Up 11% in March,,"April 03, 2023 — 09:16 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Jeremy Bowman,[],"April 03, 2023 — 09:16 pm EDT

Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) were moving higher last month as the tech giant trended with gains in the broader tech sector as tech stocks bounced back from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and fears of a recession seemed to cool off later in the month.
There was no single driver of the stock's gains in March, though it benefited from high-profile analyst upgrades, previews of its upcoming mixed-reality headset, and signs that it's continuing to focus on cost-cutting.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished March up 11%. As you can see from the chart below, the stock's gains tracked with the Nasdaq, but it rose more aggressively.

^IXIC data by YCharts.
Early in March, the company got a number of bullish analyst notes. JPMorgan said that iPhone demand is high compared to Apple's competitors, while Jefferies also found that demand was strong. 
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley boosted its price target from $175 to $180, reiterating an overweight rating and citing ""pent-up"" iPhone demand and a reacceleration in its services business. 
Shortly after that, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy rating and a price target of $199, noting the company's growing installed base of users. 
In the week of March 13, the stock started gaining again as tech stocks rebounded after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and reports confirmed that the company was planning to launch a mixed reality headset in 2023 as CEO Tim Cook pushed the company to release its device this year, according to Financial Times.
Bloomberg also reported that Apple was delaying some bonuses and expanding its hiring freeze, a sign it's expanding its cost-cutting efforts as it faces macroeconomic headwinds.
Among the big tech companies, Apple is the only one that has not announced major layoffs, but it's still a cyclical business. It can't escape the overarching in tech as recessionary threats have cooled off demand, and difficult comparisons have made growth numbers weak.
Towards the end of the month, the company also introduced its own buy-now-pay-later product, ""Apple Pay Later,"" extending the reach of its payments business.
To start April, Bloomberg reported that the company is cutting a small number of corporate retail positions, another reflection of cost-cutting, and UBS said that iPhone sell-through was down 3% in February year over year, an improvement from previous months, but still a decline.
Apple shares are expensive, but its gains last month show investors are willing to pay up for quality. Even in tough times, the company appears to be strengthening its competitive advantages and putting distance between itself and challengers like Samsung and Alphabet, which should help support its elevated valuation.

(RTTNews) - The South Korea stock market on Monday snapped the four-day winning streak in which it had advanced almost 65 points or 2.7 percent. The KOSPI now rests just above the 2,470-point plateau and it may tick lower again on Tuesday.
The global forecast for the Asian markets is a study in contrasts, with gains among oil stocks likely offset by weakness among the technology shares. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit.
The KOSPI finished slightly lower on Monday following losses from the financials, gains from the steel companies and a mixed picture from the auto and technology sectors.
For the day, the index dipped 4.52 points or 0.18 percent to finish at 2,472.34. Volume was 801.73 million shares worth 11.16 trillion won. There were 510 decliners and 370 gainers.
Among the actives, Shinhan Financial tanked 2.26 percent, while KB Financial sank 0.73 percent, Hana Financial fell 0.25 percent, Samsung Electronics weakened 1.41 percent, Samsung SDI climbed 1.36 percent, LG Electronics declined 1.30 percent, SK Hynix slumped 1.58 percent, Naver tumbled 1.88 percent, Lotte Chemical plunged 2.46 percent, S-Oil soared 2.62 percent, SK Innovation added 0.39 percent, POSCO skyrocketed 6.52 percent, SK Telecom retreated 1.55 percent, KEPCO shed 0.67 percent, Hyundai Mobis dropped 0.93 percent, Hyundai Motor lost 0.49 percent, Kia Motors rose 0.25 percent and LG Chem was unchanged.

23,A Shiba Inu Mascot Is Up on Twitter -- the Price of Dogecoin Is Soaring,,"April 03, 2023 — 05:58 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Bram Berkowitz,[],"April 03, 2023 — 05:58 pm EDT

      Written by
                        Bram Berkowitz for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


Since late afternoon yesterday, the price of the meme token Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) had surged by nearly 26% as of 3:57 p.m. ET today after the Shiba Inu mascot replaced the Blue bird icon on Twitter's home page. The price of another meme token Shiba Inu (CRYPTO: SHIB) was also up about 4.4% today for what I assume are similar reasons.
Twitter is now owned by the billionaire Elon Musk who is a well-known Dogecoin supporter, with the token supposedly being one of three cryptocurrencies that Musk owns. In many past instances, comments that Musk has made about Dogecoin have led the token's price to surge.
Today, on the home page of Twitter, a picture of a Shiba Inu dog, which is Dogecoin's mascot, replaced the Blue bird icon typically in the top left corner of Twitter's home feed. Dogecoin followers have long wondered whether Musk might incorporate some kind of crypto component into Twitter and accept Doge as payment. Furthermore, Musk tweeted out this picture below.
pic.twitter.com/wmN5WxUhfQ



Interestingly, this is all happening after Reuters earlier today reported that Musk recently asked a federal court to dismiss a $258 billion lawsuit that alleges he purposely pumped up the price of Dogecoin only to then let it plummet. 
""There is nothing unlawful about tweeting words of support for, or funny pictures about, a legitimate cryptocurrency that continues to hold a market cap of nearly $10 billion,"" said Musk's lawyers in court documents, according to Reuters. ""This court should put a stop to plaintiffs' fantasy and dismiss the complaint.""
Events like these are part of the reason I would recommend that investors stay away from a meme token like Dogecoin.
The token is extremely volatile and the most random of events can drive the price higher or lower. Other than what appears to be more devoted following than most other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has no unique advantage over other cryptocurrencies that would lead me to believe it will be a good long-term investment.

Stock markets were mixed on Monday as investors tried to chart a course for the beginning of the second quarter of 2023. The Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) suffered a modest loss on the day, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) moved sharply higher, leaving the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) stuck in the middle.

A couple of stocks were largely responsible for the Dow's big gains. With energy prices moving sharply higher, Chevron (NYSE: CVX) was a leading contributor within the Dow. However, the big mover that gave the average the biggest boost was UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), as its outsized share price and big percentage move combined to have a triple-digit influence on the Dow.
Shares of Chevron moved higher by more than 4% on Monday. The major integrated oil stock benefited from geopolitical moves in the energy market that worked to its benefit.
Crude oil prices surged almost $5 per barrel on Monday, climbing above the $80 mark. The move came after major members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced unexpected production cuts over the weekend that could reduce supplies by as much as roughly 1.15 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia made the largest cuts, reducing expected output by 500,000 barrels per day. Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait all made reductions of more than 100,000 barrels per day, and a handful of smaller countries also made more modest cuts.
For Chevron, the news comes after the oil giant posted massive profits in 2022. Net income for the year amounted to nearly $35.5 billion, drawing the ire of those struggling under inflationary pressures. Investors saw direct benefits, as the company announced a 6% dividend increase in January and authorized a gargantuan $75 billion stock repurchase program.
Chevron stock remains below its all-time high set late last year, and with an earnings multiple below 10, investors clearly believe that current levels of earnings are too good to last. Nevertheless, if oil prices remain strong, Chevron could enjoy the benefits longer than many had expected.
Shares of UnitedHealth Group, however, were the big winners on the day. The stock climbed more than 4.5%, and because of its high share price, the $21.60 per-share gain worked out to roughly 150 points of upward pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
UnitedHealth rose in concert with other health insurance stocks, partly in response to news from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The federal agency regulates  payment and reimbursement rates for those receiving healthcare benefits under the two programs, and the latest news was good from the managed care perspective. Although reimbursement rates will fall slightly for health insurers offering benefits through Medicare Advantage plans, the size of the reduction was smaller than many had feared. Moreover, Medicare and Medicaid expect to pay more for hospice care services, potentially putting more money in UnitedHealth's pocket as well.
Many investors might not realize that UnitedHealth is more than just an insurance company. Increasingly, acquisitions have given UnitedHealth much broader scope, adopting artificial intelligence to model claims experience more effectively and looking to offer more wellness services.
Looking ahead, UnitedHealth's valuation appears more expensive than Chevron's, but there could be greater opportunity for long-term growth. Both of these blue chip Dow stocks are worth a closer look for those seeking to add exposure in key areas like energy and healthcare.

25,Why UnitedHealth Stock Rocketed Nearly 5% Higher Today,,"April 03, 2023 — 05:41 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Eric Volkman,['BAC'],"April 03, 2023 — 05:41 pm EDT

Now this is the way to start a week on the stock market. The share price of top health insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) climbed 4.6% higher on some encouraging news from the federal government plus a very positive analyst note. As a result, the stock convincingly beat the 0.4% bump of the S&P 500 index on the day.
Much of UnitedHealth's Monday momentum came from the Biden administration's completion of a new set of rules for Medicare this past Friday. 
While the administration still aims to reduce overbilling through the program's Medicare Advantage private healthcare system, the new rules did not go as far as many in the health insurance sector had feared. 
Under Medicare Advantage, private-sector insurers receive fixed payments from Medicare. The insurers, in turn, become responsible for the healthcare expenses of the enrolled parties.
Meanwhile, the prognosticator thumbs-up came from influential bank and eager stock tracker Bank of America. On the kickoff of this year's calendar second quarter, the lender released its top 10 stock ideas for the period. Happily, UnitedHealth was one of the buys on that list.
The analyst team at Bank of America selected a mix of prominent companies and lesser-known titles. Its 10 ideas comprised eight enthusiastic buys -- including UnitedHealth -- and a pair of sells. UnitedHealth was the only healthcare insurance company on the list. It wasn't, however, the sole insurer -- Progressive (NYSE: PGR) also made Bank of America's top eight.

29,Why Alphabet Stock Gained 15% in March,,"April 03, 2023 — 05:12 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Jeremy Bowman,['GOOGL'],"April 03, 2023 — 05:12 pm EDT

Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) were up in March. The stock benefited from some analyst upgrades, the increasing risk that TikTok would be banned in the U.S., and the perception among some investors that the stock was undervalued.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Alphabet stock finished the month up 15%. As you can see from the chart below, those gains came in the second half of the month. This was due to the run-up to the TikTok hearings and a recovery in the broad market following the collapse of SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank.

GOOGL data by YCharts.
There was no singular reason for Alphabet's gain last month. Rather, a variety of factors combined to send shares of the tech giant higher, especially after the stock had struggled earlier in the year with the increasing threat from Microsoft and ChatGPT.
Alphabet stock rallied the week of March 13 as stocks rebounded in the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and other news items, including a report from Bank of America showing that the increase in interest in Microsoft's Bing since its announcement that it would integrate ChatGPT features hasn't impacted Google web traffic or search download activity, which has been stable since November. 
The stock gained later in the week, seemingly helped by Meta Platforms' second announcement of layoffs. Amazon also announced a second round of layoffs last month, which could also encourage Alphabet to do the same.
Finally, the stock seemed to get a tailwind from the TikTok hearings, as a number of politicians called for the popular Chinese social media app to be banned from the U.S. A ban or another type of regulatory crackdown would be bullish for Alphabet and the rest of the social media industry as TikTok is a threat to YouTube and Google Search, as Gen Z is increasingly using TikTok as a starting point for searches.
To close out the month, Alphabet stock jumped on March 31 as CFO Ruth Porat promised that the company would continue to cut costs, fulfilling hopes that the company would slash expenses further after it issued layoffs back in January. After last-month's gains, Alphabet stock now trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23, and analysts expect the company's earnings per share to decline in the first quarter before returning to growth later in the year.
Given the recessionary headwinds in the ad market and the challenges from Microsoft and ChatGPT, Alphabet stock seems to be fully valued after the latest gains.

(RTTNews) - Shares of Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. (ONCT) slipped 40% in extended hours on Monday after the company announced that Zilovertamab phase 3 study ZILO-301 and phase 1/2 study CIRM-0001 to be closed based on dynamically changing therapeutic landscape.
The Phase 3 study and the Phase 1/2 study of zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib will be closed, and other project and indirect expenses will be reduced, resulting in extending the expected cash runway into 2025, the company said in a statement.
The company plans the projected cash runway will support its clinical advancement of two pipeline assets ONCT-808 and ONCT-534.
""It is an extremely difficult decision to halt the clinical development of zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib for patients with hematologic malignancies,"" said James Breitmeyer, M.D., Ph.D., Oncternal's President and CEO. ""The dramatic adoption of recently approved Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors made the continued development of zilovertamab with ibrutinib an unviable commercial opportunity. The decision was not based on any concerns about the safety or efficacy of zilovertamab. Going forward we will focus on reaching clinical proof of concept and data catalysts from the clinical trials of ONCT-808 in patients with resistant aggressive lymphoma, and ONCT-534 in patients with prostate cancer resistant to standard of care androgen receptor inhibitors.""

After Skillz (NYSE: SKLZ) enjoyed a post-earnings pop at the end of last week, investors cooled on the stock Monday. Its price rose less than 0.6% on the day, trading essentially in line with the forgettable bump of the S&P 500 index. A fresh analyst take on the company helped dampen enthusiasm.
Before market open, Stifel analyst Drew Crum cut his price target on Skillz stock. Crum's new evaluation places the fair value of the shares at $1.25 apiece, down from his previous level of $1.50. This move doesn't make him a Skillz bear, however, as he maintained his buy recommendation on the specialty tech sector stock. 
The reasoning behind the prognosticator's move wasn't immediately apparent. He wasn't, however, the only pundit getting less enthusiastic about Skillz in the wake of the company's latest earnings release last Thursday.
Almost immediately following that event, BTIG analyst Clark Lampden also did the price target cut dance with a more drastic reduction. He now feels Skillz is worth only $0.40 per share, well below his preceding target of $0.71. He's more gloomy on the company's prospects than his Stifel peer; he kept his existing sell recommendation intact. 
Investors found enough to like in that results announcement from Skillz to subsequently push its price higher on Friday. While the company's $0.34 per-share loss for its fourth quarter was notably worse than the average analyst estimate and revenue also fell short, several key operational metrics ticked higher. Among these was both the average revenue and average gross marketplace volume (GMV) per monthly active user.

30,C3.ai Accused of Accounting Fraud. Here's What Investors Need to Know.,,"April 04, 2023 — 05:15 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Jeremy Bowman,['AI'],"April 04, 2023 — 05:15 pm EDT

      Written by
                        Jeremy Bowman for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


C3.ai (NYSE: AI) stock plunged on Tuesday after it was slammed by short-seller Kerrisdale Capital for the second time in a month.
In a scathing letter to C3.ai auditor Deloitte & Touche, on which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was copied, Kerrisdale accused the company of multiple accounting irregularities, making the case that C3.ai was inflating its revenue and gross margin in order to appear as if it's a software subscription company, even though it's really a consulting services-oriented business.
As Kerrisdale argues, subscription software businesses tend to trade at much higher multiples than consulting businesses so it's in C3.ai management's interest to inflate the multiple and the valuation because executives are compensated largely with stock and options. 
The letter also focuses on the company's complicated relationship with strategic partner Baker Hughes and how it accounts for revenue from the oil services company.
C3.ai stock fell as much as 29% on Tuesday after Kerrisdale released its letter.
Image source: Getty Images.
Kerrisdale's case centers around the company's abstruse relationship with Baker Hughes and the way it handles its receivables accounting.
Through the first three quarters of its fiscal year, C3.ai's revenue has been relatively flat, even declining in its most recent quarter. However, at the same time, accounts receivable jumped from $80.2 million to $143.7 million, while revenue rose from just $62.4 million to $66.7 million. 

AI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Since accounts receivable represents revenue that has been recorded but not yet collected, it's odd to see receivables growing so much faster than revenue. Normally, you'd expect them to grow at a similar pace, barring any change in billing practices or difficulty in collecting bills.
Additionally, many of those receivables were unbilled. As C3.ai says in its own 10-Q filing, it had $79.6 million in unbilled receivables from Baker Hughes as of Jan. 31, up from $16.5 million three quarters earlier. 
C3.ai makes no explanation for the sizable amount of unbilled receivables, though it does note that Baker Hughes accounted for 45% of its revenue in the most recent quarter, a uniquely high degree of customer concentration for a publicly traded company. 
Because of the ballooning unbilled receivables from its close strategic partner, Kerrisdale concludes that ""C3.ai is booking fictional revenue in order to meet consensus analyst estimates and cover up the fact that, in reality, its products are unable to get traction with customers and its business is failing."" Essentially, Kerrisdale is saying that it's inventing revenue that it then reports as an unbilled receivable in order to account for it on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
There's no clear answer to the question of why the company has not invoiced 30% of its reported revenue over the last nine months.
Kerrisdale's other main argument is that C3.ai is a consulting business masquerading as a software business in order to earn a higher valuation multiple.
For example, C3.ai reported $55.9 million of related party subscription revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, but no related cost of revenue, implying that the subscription software business connected to Baker Hughes has a 100% gross margin. 
According to Kerrisdale, the company is doing that to convince the market that it's a software-as-a-service company rather than a services-intensive consulting business. Kerrisdale also observed that research and development expenses exceeded gross profit in the last three quarters, leading it to believe the company is recording cost of revenue as research and development expenses to help its financial numbers look like those of a software business.
As a stock, C3.ai has had a banner year with shares having tripled at one point this year and up more than 100% year to date even after Tuesday's sell-off.
However, the performance of the business itself remains wanting. Revenue actually declined in the third quarter, falling 4.4% to $66.7 million and the company continues to be highly unprofitable on a generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) basis with a loss of $63.1 million in the third quarter and a free-cash-flow loss of $202 million through the first three quarters of the year. 
Kerrisdale is short the stock so it has an interest in the share price is falling, but its arguments are credible, and it doesn't have to be right about everything in order for C3.ai to be forced into restating its books, or worse. Investors should expect a response from C3.ai soon.
Considering the artificial intelligence stock still trades at a lofty price-to-sales valuation of around 12, the stock could have a lot more room to fall especially if Kerrisdale's claims gain traction. 
Keep your eye on upcoming news out on the report, including C3.ai's rebuttal, as these accusations aren't just going to go away on their own.

36,Why Acuity Brands Plunged Today,,"April 04, 2023 — 04:39 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Billy Duberstein,[],"April 04, 2023 — 04:39 pm EDT

      Written by
                        Billy Duberstein for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


Shares of Acuity Brands (NYSE: AYI) fell hard on Tuesday, closing the session down by 11%.
The lighting systems and intelligent spaces company fell following the delivery of its fiscal 2023 second-quarter results. While the quarter looked decent on the surface, the top-line figure wasn't high enough to please analysts. In addition, there appeared to be some fear in the market that the construction industry may slow down in the quarters ahead.
In its fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Acuity grew revenue by 3.8% to $943.6 million, missing the consensus expectation by $14.9 million, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share came in at $3.06, up 19.1%, which actually beat expectations by a significant $0.33. 
After the report came out, the stock initially rose before falling hard along with the rest of the industrial sector. The overall sector seemed to sell off in the wake of the release of the February Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which came in much lower than expected, as well as a report from the CoStar Group showing a massive decline in purchases of apartment buildings in the first quarter. 
Those indicators seemed to portend a potential downturn in the construction sector later this year, particularly if the U.S. enters a recession due to the Fed's rate hikes or if building activity is slowed by the ongoing regional bank crisis. Those factors, in combination with Acuity's light top-line numbers, led investors to bid down the stock despite the company's solid profits last quarter.
After Tuesday's sell-off, Acuity now trades at just under 15 times earnings, which is not that expensive a valuation. Moreover, the company maintained its guidance for the year of sales between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which would amount to about a 4.7% increase, along with earnings per share between $13 and $14.50, which would be an increase of 7.2% at the midpoint. 
Management projects low-to-mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth in its lighting solutions segment, along with mid-teens growth in its Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG), which comprises control systems to help buildings operate more efficiently, and which made up 6.1% of revenues last quarter. 
That's no doubt a big deceleration from last year's mid-teens growth, but at this valuation, and with the company profitable enough to repurchase stock, Acuity Brands looks rather cheap now. As long as we don't go into a prolonged recession, the stock could be a buy on further weakness due to macroeconomic fears.

37,"2 Biotech Stocks That Could Soar by 130% and 92%, According to Wall Street",,"April 04, 2023 — 04:30 pm EDT",['Markets'],,George Budwell,"['ARWR', 'NSRGY']","April 04, 2023 — 04:30 pm EDT

The Motley Fool ->


Biotech stocks got pummeled in 2022. Valuations across the small- and mid-cap biotech landscape cratered last year as the concept of ""deep value"" got zeroed out by rising interest rates and a general flight to safety.
As a result, there are scores of developmental biotech companies trading at a fraction of their net cash positions right now. This tsunami of selling in the space, though, has seemingly created some tremendous opportunities for investors with a long-term mindset. 
Image source: Getty Images.
Which biotech stocks sport the juiciest risk-to-reward ratios right now? The following two stocks are screaming buys, based on their underappreciated pipelines and near-term prospects. 
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARWR) is a leader in the emerging gene silencing space via its cutting-edge RNA interference platform. The company sports a wide variety of licensing deals and big-pharma collaborations, which has given it one of the longest cash runways within the clinical-stage biotech space (almost four years, based on its current burn rate and recent milestone payments).
Still, Arrowhead's value proposition has failed to land with investors. Thanks to a foggy data readout in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD) liver disease and Johnson & Johnson ending their $3.7 billion collaboration, Arrowhead's shares have taken a nearly 50% haircut over the prior year.
The stock's bullish analysts, though, think this decline is overdone. Speaking to this point, the consensus price target on Arrowhead's shares currently implies a staggering 130% upside potential. 
What's ahead? Over the course of 2023, Arrowhead is expected to initiate a handful of late-stage trials and announce a bevy of top-line clinical data across a wide variety of indications. The company thus has a real chance at creating enormous value for shareholders this year.
That being said, Arrowhead is a long-term play, due to the extended timelines inherent in drug development. As such, its stock is best suited to investors with an elevated tolerance for risk.   
Seres Therapeutics (NASDAQ: MCRB), a microbiome therapeutics company, is on the cusp of a major regulatory approval that could light a fire underneath its shares soon. In brief, Seres is expected to learn the regulatory fate of its orally administered Clostridioides difficile treatment known as SER-109 by April 26, 2023. 
The therapy would likely gobble up market share as an alternative to one-time rectally administered treatments. C. difficile is a fairly common bacterial infection that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. 
Wall Street analysts think that SER-109, at its peak, could rake in upwards of $750 million in annual sales. That's quite a haul for a company with a sub-$1 billion market cap.
The one minor drawback is that Seres has a co-commercialization agreement in place with Nestlé Health Science. As a result, the biotech will have to share profits from SER-109's sales on a 50/50 basis. That being said, Seres could grab additional payments worth up to $350 million if the therapy reaches certain regulatory and commercial milestones.
All told, Seres stock has a very realistic shot at a dramatic upward move in the event this novel microbiome therapy reaches the market.

RTTNews ->


(RTTNews) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Tuesday said it was setting aside $8.9 billion to resolve all claims related to talc-based powders.
Johnson & Johnson announced that its subsidiary LTL Management LLC (LTL) has re-filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to obtain approval of a reorganization plan that will equitably and efficiently resolve all claims arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the company and its affiliates in North America.
The company has agreed to contribute up to a present value of $8.9 billion, payable over 25 years, to resolve all the current and future talc claims, which is an increase of $6.9 billion over the $2 billion previously committed in connection with LTL's initial bankruptcy filing in October 2021. LTL also has secured commitments from over 60,000 current claimants to support a global resolution on these terms.
Johnson & Johnson and its other affiliates did not file for bankruptcy protection and will continue to operate their businesses as usual.
""The Company continues to believe that these claims are specious and lack scientific merit,"" said Erik Haas, Worldwide Vice President of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson. ""However, as the Bankruptcy Court recognized, resolving these cases in the tort system would take decades and impose significant costs on LTL and the system, with most claimants never receiving any compensation.""

The major index logged a string of losses for Tuesday's session, lower on news that job openings data fell for the first time in two years, to just below 10 million. As investors digest the suggestion of a slowing economy just one day off of oil's big post-cut pricing surge, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), snapped its seven-day losing streak.

Gold enjoyed a sizable jump this afternoon, as commodity investors digested jobs data out of the U.S. June-dated gold added $37.80 or 1.9%, to settle at $2,038.20.

30,C3.ai Accused of Accounting Fraud. Here's What Investors Need to Know.,,"April 04, 2023 — 05:15 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Jeremy Bowman,['AI'],"April 04, 2023 — 05:15 pm EDT

The Motley Fool ->


C3.ai (NYSE: AI) stock plunged on Tuesday after it was slammed by short-seller Kerrisdale Capital for the second time in a month.
In a scathing letter to C3.ai auditor Deloitte & Touche, on which the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was copied, Kerrisdale accused the company of multiple accounting irregularities, making the case that C3.ai was inflating its revenue and gross margin in order to appear as if it's a software subscription company, even though it's really a consulting services-oriented business.
As Kerrisdale argues, subscription software businesses tend to trade at much higher multiples than consulting businesses so it's in C3.ai management's interest to inflate the multiple and the valuation because executives are compensated largely with stock and options. 
The letter also focuses on the company's complicated relationship with strategic partner Baker Hughes and how it accounts for revenue from the oil services company.
C3.ai stock fell as much as 29% on Tuesday after Kerrisdale released its letter.
Image source: Getty Images.
Kerrisdale's case centers around the company's abstruse relationship with Baker Hughes and the way it handles its receivables accounting.
Through the first three quarters of its fiscal year, C3.ai's revenue has been relatively flat, even declining in its most recent quarter. However, at the same time, accounts receivable jumped from $80.2 million to $143.7 million, while revenue rose from just $62.4 million to $66.7 million. 

AI Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts
Since accounts receivable represents revenue that has been recorded but not yet collected, it's odd to see receivables growing so much faster than revenue. Normally, you'd expect them to grow at a similar pace, barring any change in billing practices or difficulty in collecting bills.
Additionally, many of those receivables were unbilled. As C3.ai says in its own 10-Q filing, it had $79.6 million in unbilled receivables from Baker Hughes as of Jan. 31, up from $16.5 million three quarters earlier. 
C3.ai makes no explanation for the sizable amount of unbilled receivables, though it does note that Baker Hughes accounted for 45% of its revenue in the most recent quarter, a uniquely high degree of customer concentration for a publicly traded company. 
Because of the ballooning unbilled receivables from its close strategic partner, Kerrisdale concludes that ""C3.ai is booking fictional revenue in order to meet consensus analyst estimates and cover up the fact that, in reality, its products are unable to get traction with customers and its business is failing."" Essentially, Kerrisdale is saying that it's inventing revenue that it then reports as an unbilled receivable in order to account for it on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
There's no clear answer to the question of why the company has not invoiced 30% of its reported revenue over the last nine months.
Kerrisdale's other main argument is that C3.ai is a consulting business masquerading as a software business in order to earn a higher valuation multiple.
For example, C3.ai reported $55.9 million of related party subscription revenue for the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, but no related cost of revenue, implying that the subscription software business connected to Baker Hughes has a 100% gross margin. 
According to Kerrisdale, the company is doing that to convince the market that it's a software-as-a-service company rather than a services-intensive consulting business. Kerrisdale also observed that research and development expenses exceeded gross profit in the last three quarters, leading it to believe the company is recording cost of revenue as research and development expenses to help its financial numbers look like those of a software business.
As a stock, C3.ai has had a banner year with shares having tripled at one point this year and up more than 100% year to date even after Tuesday's sell-off.
However, the performance of the business itself remains wanting. Revenue actually declined in the third quarter, falling 4.4% to $66.7 million and the company continues to be highly unprofitable on a generally acceptable accounting principles (GAAP) basis with a loss of $63.1 million in the third quarter and a free-cash-flow loss of $202 million through the first three quarters of the year. 
Kerrisdale is short the stock so it has an interest in the share price is falling, but its arguments are credible, and it doesn't have to be right about everything in order for C3.ai to be forced into restating its books, or worse. Investors should expect a response from C3.ai soon.
Considering the artificial intelligence stock still trades at a lofty price-to-sales valuation of around 12, the stock could have a lot more room to fall especially if Kerrisdale's claims gain traction. 
Keep your eye on upcoming news out on the report, including C3.ai's rebuttal, as these accusations aren't just going to go away on their own.

RTTNews ->


(RTTNews) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Tuesday said it was setting aside $8.9 billion to resolve all claims related to talc-based powders.
Johnson & Johnson announced that its subsidiary LTL Management LLC (LTL) has re-filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to obtain approval of a reorganization plan that will equitably and efficiently resolve all claims arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the company and its affiliates in North America.
The company has agreed to contribute up to a present value of $8.9 billion, payable over 25 years, to resolve all the current and future talc claims, which is an increase of $6.9 billion over the $2 billion previously committed in connection with LTL's initial bankruptcy filing in October 2021. LTL also has secured commitments from over 60,000 current claimants to support a global resolution on these terms.
Johnson & Johnson and its other affiliates did not file for bankruptcy protection and will continue to operate their businesses as usual.
""The Company continues to believe that these claims are specious and lack scientific merit,"" said Erik Haas, Worldwide Vice President of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson. ""However, as the Bankruptcy Court recognized, resolving these cases in the tort system would take decades and impose significant costs on LTL and the system, with most claimants never receiving any compensation.""

36,Why Acuity Brands Plunged Today,,"April 04, 2023 — 04:39 pm EDT",['Markets'],,Billy Duberstein,[],"April 04, 2023 — 04:39 pm EDT

      Written by
                        Billy Duberstein for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


Shares of Acuity Brands (NYSE: AYI) fell hard on Tuesday, closing the session down by 11%.
The lighting systems and intelligent spaces company fell following the delivery of its fiscal 2023 second-quarter results. While the quarter looked decent on the surface, the top-line figure wasn't high enough to please analysts. In addition, there appeared to be some fear in the market that the construction industry may slow down in the quarters ahead.
In its fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Acuity grew revenue by 3.8% to $943.6 million, missing the consensus expectation by $14.9 million, while adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share came in at $3.06, up 19.1%, which actually beat expectations by a significant $0.33. 
After the report came out, the stock initially rose before falling hard along with the rest of the industrial sector. The overall sector seemed to sell off in the wake of the release of the February Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which came in much lower than expected, as well as a report from the CoStar Group showing a massive decline in purchases of apartment buildings in the first quarter. 
Those indicators seemed to portend a potential downturn in the construction sector later this year, particularly if the U.S. enters a recession due to the Fed's rate hikes or if building activity is slowed by the ongoing regional bank crisis. Those factors, in combination with Acuity's light top-line numbers, led investors to bid down the stock despite the company's solid profits last quarter.
After Tuesday's sell-off, Acuity now trades at just under 15 times earnings, which is not that expensive a valuation. Moreover, the company maintained its guidance for the year of sales between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion, which would amount to about a 4.7% increase, along with earnings per share between $13 and $14.50, which would be an increase of 7.2% at the midpoint. 
Management projects low-to-mid-single-digit percentage revenue growth in its lighting solutions segment, along with mid-teens growth in its Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG), which comprises control systems to help buildings operate more efficiently, and which made up 6.1% of revenues last quarter. 
That's no doubt a big deceleration from last year's mid-teens growth, but at this valuation, and with the company profitable enough to repurchase stock, Acuity Brands looks rather cheap now. As long as we don't go into a prolonged recession, the stock could be a buy on further weakness due to macroeconomic fears.

37,"2 Biotech Stocks That Could Soar by 130% and 92%, According to Wall Street",,"April 04, 2023 — 04:30 pm EDT",['Markets'],,George Budwell,"['ARWR', 'NSRGY']","April 04, 2023 — 04:30 pm EDT

The Motley Fool ->


Biotech stocks got pummeled in 2022. Valuations across the small- and mid-cap biotech landscape cratered last year as the concept of ""deep value"" got zeroed out by rising interest rates and a general flight to safety.
As a result, there are scores of developmental biotech companies trading at a fraction of their net cash positions right now. This tsunami of selling in the space, though, has seemingly created some tremendous opportunities for investors with a long-term mindset. 
Image source: Getty Images.
Which biotech stocks sport the juiciest risk-to-reward ratios right now? The following two stocks are screaming buys, based on their underappreciated pipelines and near-term prospects. 
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ARWR) is a leader in the emerging gene silencing space via its cutting-edge RNA interference platform. The company sports a wide variety of licensing deals and big-pharma collaborations, which has given it one of the longest cash runways within the clinical-stage biotech space (almost four years, based on its current burn rate and recent milestone payments).
Still, Arrowhead's value proposition has failed to land with investors. Thanks to a foggy data readout in alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD) liver disease and Johnson & Johnson ending their $3.7 billion collaboration, Arrowhead's shares have taken a nearly 50% haircut over the prior year.
The stock's bullish analysts, though, think this decline is overdone. Speaking to this point, the consensus price target on Arrowhead's shares currently implies a staggering 130% upside potential. 
What's ahead? Over the course of 2023, Arrowhead is expected to initiate a handful of late-stage trials and announce a bevy of top-line clinical data across a wide variety of indications. The company thus has a real chance at creating enormous value for shareholders this year.
That being said, Arrowhead is a long-term play, due to the extended timelines inherent in drug development. As such, its stock is best suited to investors with an elevated tolerance for risk.   
Seres Therapeutics (NASDAQ: MCRB), a microbiome therapeutics company, is on the cusp of a major regulatory approval that could light a fire underneath its shares soon. In brief, Seres is expected to learn the regulatory fate of its orally administered Clostridioides difficile treatment known as SER-109 by April 26, 2023. 
The therapy would likely gobble up market share as an alternative to one-time rectally administered treatments. C. difficile is a fairly common bacterial infection that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon. 
Wall Street analysts think that SER-109, at its peak, could rake in upwards of $750 million in annual sales. That's quite a haul for a company with a sub-$1 billion market cap.
The one minor drawback is that Seres has a co-commercialization agreement in place with Nestlé Health Science. As a result, the biotech will have to share profits from SER-109's sales on a 50/50 basis. That being said, Seres could grab additional payments worth up to $350 million if the therapy reaches certain regulatory and commercial milestones.
All told, Seres stock has a very realistic shot at a dramatic upward move in the event this novel microbiome therapy reaches the market.

51,EXCLUSIVE-Canada regulator steps up antitrust review of Smith Financial bid for Home Capital,,"April 04, 2023 — 04:05 pm EDT","['Markets', 'US', 'Markets']",,Divya Rajagopal,['RY'],"April 04, 2023 — 04:05 pm EDT

Reuters ->


By Divya Rajagopal and Maiya Keidan
TORONTO, April 4 (Reuters) - Canada's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it has sought additional information in its review of Smith Financial Corp's planned C$1.7 billion ($1.3 billion) bid for lender Home Capital Group Inc (HCG)HCG.TO.
The Competition Bureau Canada was responding to a Reuters query on whether it had issued the companies any supplementary information request (SIR).
""I can confirm that the Competition Bureau is reviewing the potential acquisition of Home Capital Group by Smith Financial Corporation,"" a bureau spokesperson said in an email.
The regulator declined to provide a timeline of its review, saying it is obligated to ""conduct its work confidentially."" Home Capital and Smith Financial were unavailable for immediate comment.
The bureau seeks additional information from merger partners when an acquisition raises concerns about substantial lessening of competition.
Canada's already consolidated banking industry had two more M&A deals last year, including Smith Financial's Home Capital bid, giving six lenders control of about 90% of the market. Consumer advocates have complained about higher transaction fees than in the United States.
Last year, Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO announced the purchase of HSBC's Canada unit, a transaction also under regulatory review.
Home Capital, rescued by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N five years ago, announced in November it would be taken private by Smith Financial. Canada's housing market and mortgage lendingslowed as interest rates spiked after exponential price growth during the pandemic.
Home Capital, which caters to borrowers shunned by big lenders, set aside C$10.4 million for bad loan in the 2022 fourth quarter, up from C$1 million in the year-ago period. 
""There is no surprise that the competition bureau is reviewing this transaction; in fact, it should have been expected,"" said Arthur Salzer, CEO at Northland Wealth Management, a Home Capital shareholder.
Salzer said he expects the sale to be approved and Home Capital to retain its focus on so-called alternative borrowers with weaker income documentation, such as the self-employed, new immigrants and those with a poor credit history.
Controlled by billionaire Stephen Smith, Smith Financial is also the co-founder of Home Capital's larger rival First National Financial Corp FN.TO. It is a top shareholder of lender EQB Inc EQB.TO, one of Canada's leading alternative lenders and the country's ninth largest publicly traded bank.
The competition bureau's main concern is that the Home Capital deal will result in Smith Financial controlling too large a share of the alternate market, said a hedge manager who is closely watching the transaction.
Smith also co-owns Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Company, in partnership with Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan. He is chairman and co-owner of Duo Bank of Canada.
Shareholders voted 99.8% in favor of approving the deal at a special meeting on Feb. 8.
If Smith Financial does not close the deal before the May 20 deadline, it has to pay shareholders an extra 25 Canadian cents per share for every three months of delay.

50,U.S. Stocks Give Back Ground Following Recent Strength,,"April 04, 2023 — 04:09 pm EDT",['Markets'],,RTTNews.com,[],"April 04, 2023 — 04:09 pm EDT

      Written by
                        RTTNews.com for                             
        




RTTNews ->


(RTTNews) - After trending higher in recent sessions, stocks moved back to the downside over the course of the trading day on Tuesday. The major averages showed a lack of direction early in the session but slid firmly into negative territory as the day progressed.
The major averages regained some ground going into the close but remained in the red. The Dow slid 198.77 points or 0.6 percent to 33,402.38, the Nasdaq fell 63.13 points or 0.5 percent to 12,126.37 and the S&P 500 declined 23.91 points or 0.6 percent to 4,100.60.
Profit taking contributed to the pullback on Wall Street, as traders cashed in on recent strength in the markets amid lingering concerns about the global economic outlook.
The Dow and the S&P 500 closed higher for the fourth straight session on Monday, reaching their best closing levels in over a month, while the Nasdaq pulled back just off the six-month closing high set last Friday.
Negative sentiment was also generated by a Labor Department report showing job openings in the U.S. decreased by more than expected in the month of February.
The report said job openings fell to 9.9 million in February from a revised 10.6 million in January. Economists had expected job openings to decline to 10.4 million from the 10.8 million originally reported for the previous month.
""February's JOLTS report is an indication that the softening in the labor market may be gaining some momentum,"" said Matthew Martin, U.S. Economist at Oxford Economics.
He added, ""To be sure, job openings remain highly elevated, but February's level is the first month below 10k since June 2021 and suggests businesses are becoming more wary about additional headcount.
A separate report released by the Commerce Department showed new orders for U.S. manufactured goods fell by more than expected in the month of February.
Traders also continued to look ahead to the release of the Labor Department's closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.
Economists currently expect the report to show employment increased by 240,000 jobs in March after climbing by 311,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold at 3.6 percent.
While the markets will be closed for Good Friday when the report is released, the data could still impact the outlook for interest rates and the economy.
Sector News
Steel stocks showed a substantial pullback on the day, with the NYSE Arca Steel Index plunging by 4.1 percent after closing higher for eight straight sessions.
Considerable weakness also emerged among energy stocks, which gave back ground after soaring on Monday along with the price of crude oil.
Despite a continued increase by the price of crude oil, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index tumbled by 2.9 percent and the NYSE Arca Oil Index dove by 2.7 percent.
Banking stocks also showed significant move to the downside over the course of the session, dragging the KBW Bank Index down by 2.0 percent.
Housing, semiconductor and transportation stocks also saw notable weakness, while gold stocks bucked the downtrend amid a sharp increase by the price of the precious metal.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.4 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.5 percent.
Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the German DAX Index inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index closed nearly unchanged and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index fell by 0.5 percent.
In the bond market, treasuries moved sharply higher over the course of the session after seeing initial weakness. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, slumped by 9.3 basis points to 3.337 percent.
Looking Ahead
Trading on Wednesday may be impacted by reaction to reports on private sector employment, service sector activity and the U.S. trade deficit.

BNK Invest ->


In trading on Tuesday, shares of Ardagh Metal Packaging SA (Symbol: AMBP) entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $3.785 per share.  We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.  



In the case of Ardagh Metal Packaging SA, the RSI reading has hit 29.2 — by comparison, the universe of metals and mining stocks covered by Metals Channel currently has an average RSI of 54.2, the RSI of Spot Gold is at 15.7, and the RSI of Spot Silver is presently 22.4.

A bullish investor could look at AMBP's 29.2 reading as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.



Looking at a chart of one year performance (below), AMBP's low point in its 52 week range is $3.6543 per share, with $8.33 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $3.79.  Ardagh Metal Packaging SA shares are currently trading down about 8.2% on the day.

62,Interesting FIVE Put And Call Options For June 2024,,"April 03, 2023 — 11:17 am EDT","['Markets', 'Stocks', 'Options']",,BNK Invest,[],"April 03, 2023 — 11:17 am EDT

                        BNK Invest for                             
        




BNK Invest ->


Investors in Five Below Inc (Symbol: FIVE) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 445 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FIVE options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $200.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $200.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $174.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FIVE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $206.95/share today.


Because the $200.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.85% return on the cash commitment, or 10.54% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Five Below Inc, and highlighting in green where the $200.00 strike is located relative to that history:












Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $37.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FIVE stock at the current price level of $206.95/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $210.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 19.79% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FIVE shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Five Below Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FIVE's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $210.00 strike highlighted in red:















Considering the fact that the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 18.31% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.02% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.



Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $206.95) to be 49%.  For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Investors in First Solar Inc (Symbol: FSLR) saw new options become available today, for the September 2024 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 536 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FSLR options chain for the new September 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $200.00 strike price has a current bid of $34.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $200.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $165.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FSLR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $207.89/share today.


Because the $200.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 17.05% return on the cash commitment, or 11.61% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for First Solar Inc, and highlighting in green where the $200.00 strike is located relative to that history:












Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $49.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FSLR stock at the current price level of $207.89/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $210.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 24.92% if the stock gets called away at the September 2024 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FSLR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for First Solar Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FSLR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $210.00 strike highlighted in red:















Considering the fact that the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 23.91% boost of extra return to the investor, or 16.28% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.



Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $207.89) to be 51%.  For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Reuters ->


By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday ordered Illumina ILMN.O to divest cancer diagnostic test maker Grail, finding that its ownership would stifle competition in the U.S. market for cancer tests.
Illumina said it would appeal the decision, and will seek expedited consideration from an appeals court. The company said the FTC order to unwind the deal would be automatically put on hold.
Judge Michael Chappell, an administrative law judge at the agency, ruled last year that the $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail would not hurt competition. The FTC staff appealed the decision to agency leadership.
The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, first filed a complaint in March 2021 to stop Illumina's bid for its former subsidiary.
The agency has expressed concern that Illumina, the dominant provider of DNA sequencing of tumors and cancer cells that help match patients with the best treatment option, might raise prices or refuse to keep selling to rivals of Grail, which is seeking to market a powerful test to diagnose many kinds of cancer from a single blood test, known as liquid biopsy.
At a December hearing, Illumina pledged to keep selling its DNA sequencing services to other firms. It has offered to sign contracts to supply any of Grail's rivals and to not raise prices.
Meanwhile, Illumina completed the takeover of Grail in August 2021, despite the lack of regulatory approval from Europe or the United States.

Investors in The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (Symbol: XLE) saw new options become available today, for the March 2024 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 360 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLE options chain for the new March 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $86.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $86.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $86.48/share today.


Because the $86.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

68,Why Tesla Stock Fell Monday,,"April 03, 2023 — 11:12 am EDT",['Markets'],,Howard Smith,[],"April 03, 2023 — 11:12 am EDT

      Written by
                        Howard Smith for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) released its first-quarter delivery data yesterday, and the stock is in decline as a result. The company delivered a record 422,875 electric vehicles (EVs) in the first quarter, but some investors were still disappointed. Shares were down by 5.2% as of 10:30 a.m. ET on Monday. 
In addition to record deliveries, the company produced a record number of EVs in the quarterly period. The stock is lower, however, as some investors must have thought the results were below estimates. High overall expectations had helped push the stock higher by about 8% over the last week heading into the delivery news. 

There was a wide range of estimates for first-quarter deliveries after Tesla slashed vehicle prices. Some expected a surge in demand to help the company deliver more EVs than it did. Analyst estimates ranged from as low as 410,000 to about 450,000. So whether the company beat or missed expectations depends on which analysts you followed.
But overall production of nearly 441,000 would still leave the company slightly short of its own guidance for 1.8 million EVs for the full year if extrapolated to the remainder of the year. Investors who were disappointed may have missed two things, however.
Image source: Tesla.
First, the Semi heavy-truck production and delivery data was not included in the results. Perhaps more important, volume continues to ramp up at its two newest factories, in Texas and Germany. So extrapolating first-quarter production out to the rest of the year isn't really applicable if demand remains strong this year and those factories continue to increase production. 
An area of concern last year was the growing gap between production and deliveries. Tesla followers wondered if that meant inventory was growing or if there were logistics problems. But that was a big bright spot in the first quarter. In the prior quarter, Tesla produced nearly 8% more vehicles than it delivered. But in the first quarter, that gap narrowed to just 4%.
So transit logistics certainly improved, and it also seems to confirm that there was not an inventory buildup due to declining demand. That's good news for shareholders and helps indicate that today's reaction in the market doesn't make much sense. Investors will get even more information when Tesla reports its full first-quarter financial results in less than three weeks on April 19.

63,3 Hot Stocks That Have Already More Than Doubled in 2023,,"April 03, 2023 — 11:15 am EDT",['Markets'],,Rick Munarriz,['CVNA'],"April 03, 2023 — 11:15 am EDT

                        Rick Munarriz for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


We're now three months deep into 2023, and some stocks squeezed a lot of juice out of their first-quarter performance. The market is higher this year, but a handful of stocks have already more than doubled. Some of the names might surprise you.
Some of the names you might know are Carvana (NYSE: CVNA), Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), and Fastly (NYSE: FSLY). Let's take a closer look at these three unlikely leaders that hit the ground running in 2023.
You might live in a city where a Carvana multilevel glass-enclosed vending machine is a skyline icon. If not, you've probably seen one of its ads. Carvana sells used cars nationwide, and its aggressive expansion at one point served up 23 consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth.
Image source: Getty Images.
Last year was rough for Carvana for a couple of reasons. We can start with the end of the boom for secondhand vehicles. Demand and prices for used cars took off early in the pandemic when there was a shortage of new cars available, but that trend reversed when supply chain constraints eased in 2022 and that new-car smell became a showroom staple again.
The other problem is that the car reseller took on a lot of debt during its breakneck expansion, and with borrowing costs skyrocketing as interest rates revved up last year, Carvana creditors started to get nervous. 
The risks of going under are still real at Carvana. It's shaving costs, but bondholders reportedly aren't keen on its restructuring efforts. Wedbush analyst Seth Basham put out a bearish note two weeks ago, arguing that a recent exchange offer for unsecured bonds may not be enough. 
With business expected to decline this year, Carvana's negotiating leverage may continue to deteriorate with its creditors. Basham is sticking to his $1 price target, even as the shares approach double digits.
The most valuable company by market cap to more than double in the first quarter is another household name. Duolingo's language-learning app has been popular for a few years now, but its recent surge is truly impressive. 
The biggest catalyst to the stock's pop came at the end of February, when it posted blowout financial results. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 42% to $103.8 million in the fourth quarter. Its monthly active users have climbed to 60.7 million over the past year, a healthy 43% jump. Daily engagement is even stronger, as daily active users have spiked 62% to 16.3 million as 2022 played out.
Duolingo's CEO claims that his language software experienced growth in every region of the world, and that makes sense. International travel restrictions finally started to ease up late last year. There's a lot of pent-up travel demand, and that's a great reason to brush up on a foreign language. 
Profitability has been a problem for Duolingo, but its fourth-quarter report was also notable on the bottom line. The $0.35-a-share loss it posted was considerably better than the $0.53-a-share deficit that Wall Street pros were modeling. In Duolingo's defense, it posted less red ink than the market was forecasting every quarter of 2022. 
The outlook is where a solid report becomes spectacular. Duolingo's guidance calls for $530 million to $542 million in revenue this year, a 45% top-line jump at the midpoint. Analysts were only holding out for $464.5 million. The news gets even better on the earnings front, as the $48.6 million to $59.8 million is more than triple the $15.5 million it delivered in 2022.  
Another stock on the rise after a head-turning quarterly update is Fastly. The edge-computing specialist was a market darling a few years ago, growing quickly and helping a growing number of businesses accelerate the delivery of their digital content. It then lost a key account -- cough, cough, TikTok -- and stumbled out of favor with investors. 
Fastly exceeded Wall Street expectations on both ends of the income statement in February's fourth-quarter report. Like Duolingo, its guidance was also refreshing. Two days before the well-received financials, Fastly stock received a rare double upgrade from Bank of America analyst Tal Liani.
New management's effort to streamline Fastly's product portfolio, pricing, and operations could be the key to improving margins. With revenue growth accelerating in the second half of 2022, the recovery plan appears to be working on the top line, too.

Investors in Five Below Inc (Symbol: FIVE) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 2024 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 445 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FIVE options chain for the new June 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $200.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $200.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $174.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FIVE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $206.95/share today.


Because the $200.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 12.85% return on the cash commitment, or 10.54% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Five Below Inc, and highlighting in green where the $200.00 strike is located relative to that history:












Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $210.00 strike price has a current bid of $37.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FIVE stock at the current price level of $206.95/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $210.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 19.79% if the stock gets called away at the June 2024 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FIVE shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Five Below Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FIVE's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $210.00 strike highlighted in red:















Considering the fact that the $210.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 18.31% boost of extra return to the investor, or 15.02% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.



Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $206.95) to be 49%.  For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

63,3 Hot Stocks That Have Already More Than Doubled in 2023,,"April 03, 2023 — 11:15 am EDT",['Markets'],,Rick Munarriz,['CVNA'],"April 03, 2023 — 11:15 am EDT

The Motley Fool ->


We're now three months deep into 2023, and some stocks squeezed a lot of juice out of their first-quarter performance. The market is higher this year, but a handful of stocks have already more than doubled. Some of the names might surprise you.
Some of the names you might know are Carvana (NYSE: CVNA), Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL), and Fastly (NYSE: FSLY). Let's take a closer look at these three unlikely leaders that hit the ground running in 2023.
You might live in a city where a Carvana multilevel glass-enclosed vending machine is a skyline icon. If not, you've probably seen one of its ads. Carvana sells used cars nationwide, and its aggressive expansion at one point served up 23 consecutive quarters of triple-digit growth.
Image source: Getty Images.
Last year was rough for Carvana for a couple of reasons. We can start with the end of the boom for secondhand vehicles. Demand and prices for used cars took off early in the pandemic when there was a shortage of new cars available, but that trend reversed when supply chain constraints eased in 2022 and that new-car smell became a showroom staple again.
The other problem is that the car reseller took on a lot of debt during its breakneck expansion, and with borrowing costs skyrocketing as interest rates revved up last year, Carvana creditors started to get nervous. 
The risks of going under are still real at Carvana. It's shaving costs, but bondholders reportedly aren't keen on its restructuring efforts. Wedbush analyst Seth Basham put out a bearish note two weeks ago, arguing that a recent exchange offer for unsecured bonds may not be enough. 
With business expected to decline this year, Carvana's negotiating leverage may continue to deteriorate with its creditors. Basham is sticking to his $1 price target, even as the shares approach double digits.
The most valuable company by market cap to more than double in the first quarter is another household name. Duolingo's language-learning app has been popular for a few years now, but its recent surge is truly impressive. 
The biggest catalyst to the stock's pop came at the end of February, when it posted blowout financial results. Revenue rose a better-than-expected 42% to $103.8 million in the fourth quarter. Its monthly active users have climbed to 60.7 million over the past year, a healthy 43% jump. Daily engagement is even stronger, as daily active users have spiked 62% to 16.3 million as 2022 played out.
Duolingo's CEO claims that his language software experienced growth in every region of the world, and that makes sense. International travel restrictions finally started to ease up late last year. There's a lot of pent-up travel demand, and that's a great reason to brush up on a foreign language. 
Profitability has been a problem for Duolingo, but its fourth-quarter report was also notable on the bottom line. The $0.35-a-share loss it posted was considerably better than the $0.53-a-share deficit that Wall Street pros were modeling. In Duolingo's defense, it posted less red ink than the market was forecasting every quarter of 2022. 
The outlook is where a solid report becomes spectacular. Duolingo's guidance calls for $530 million to $542 million in revenue this year, a 45% top-line jump at the midpoint. Analysts were only holding out for $464.5 million. The news gets even better on the earnings front, as the $48.6 million to $59.8 million is more than triple the $15.5 million it delivered in 2022.  
Another stock on the rise after a head-turning quarterly update is Fastly. The edge-computing specialist was a market darling a few years ago, growing quickly and helping a growing number of businesses accelerate the delivery of their digital content. It then lost a key account -- cough, cough, TikTok -- and stumbled out of favor with investors. 
Fastly exceeded Wall Street expectations on both ends of the income statement in February's fourth-quarter report. Like Duolingo, its guidance was also refreshing. Two days before the well-received financials, Fastly stock received a rare double upgrade from Bank of America analyst Tal Liani.
New management's effort to streamline Fastly's product portfolio, pricing, and operations could be the key to improving margins. With revenue growth accelerating in the second half of 2022, the recovery plan appears to be working on the top line, too.

Investors in The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (Symbol: XLE) saw new options become available today, for the March 2024 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 360 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the XLE options chain for the new March 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $86.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $86.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.40 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of XLE, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $86.48/share today.


Because the $86.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.00% return on the cash commitment, or 10.14% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

If an investor was to purchase shares of XLE stock at the current price level of $86.48/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $87.00.

Reuters ->


By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday ordered Illumina ILMN.O to divest cancer diagnostic test maker Grail, finding that its ownership would stifle competition in the U.S. market for cancer tests.
Illumina said it would appeal the decision, and will seek expedited consideration from an appeals court. The company said the FTC order to unwind the deal would be automatically put on hold.
Judge Michael Chappell, an administrative law judge at the agency, ruled last year that the $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail would not hurt competition. The FTC staff appealed the decision to agency leadership.
The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, first filed a complaint in March 2021 to stop Illumina's bid for its former subsidiary.
The agency has expressed concern that Illumina, the dominant provider of DNA sequencing of tumors and cancer cells that help match patients with the best treatment option, might raise prices or refuse to keep selling to rivals of Grail, which is seeking to market a powerful test to diagnose many kinds of cancer from a single blood test, known as liquid biopsy.
At a December hearing, Illumina pledged to keep selling its DNA sequencing services to other firms. It has offered to sign contracts to supply any of Grail's rivals and to not raise prices.
Meanwhile, Illumina completed the takeover of Grail in August 2021, despite the lack of regulatory approval from Europe or the United States.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of LTHM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $21.32/share today.


Because the $21.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

68,Why Tesla Stock Fell Monday,,"April 03, 2023 — 11:12 am EDT",['Markets'],,Howard Smith,[],"April 03, 2023 — 11:12 am EDT

      Written by
                        Howard Smith for                             
        




The Motley Fool ->


Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) released its first-quarter delivery data yesterday, and the stock is in decline as a result. The company delivered a record 422,875 electric vehicles (EVs) in the first quarter, but some investors were still disappointed. Shares were down by 5.2% as of 10:30 a.m. ET on Monday. 
In addition to record deliveries, the company produced a record number of EVs in the quarterly period. The stock is lower, however, as some investors must have thought the results were below estimates. High overall expectations had helped push the stock higher by about 8% over the last week heading into the delivery news. 

There was a wide range of estimates for first-quarter deliveries after Tesla slashed vehicle prices. Some expected a surge in demand to help the company deliver more EVs than it did. Analyst estimates ranged from as low as 410,000 to about 450,000. So whether the company beat or missed expectations depends on which analysts you followed.
But overall production of nearly 441,000 would still leave the company slightly short of its own guidance for 1.8 million EVs for the full year if extrapolated to the remainder of the year. Investors who were disappointed may have missed two things, however.
Image source: Tesla.
First, the Semi heavy-truck production and delivery data was not included in the results. Perhaps more important, volume continues to ramp up at its two newest factories, in Texas and Germany. So extrapolating first-quarter production out to the rest of the year isn't really applicable if demand remains strong this year and those factories continue to increase production. 
An area of concern last year was the growing gap between production and deliveries. Tesla followers wondered if that meant inventory was growing or if there were logistics problems. But that was a big bright spot in the first quarter. In the prior quarter, Tesla produced nearly 8% more vehicles than it delivered. But in the first quarter, that gap narrowed to just 4%.
So transit logistics certainly improved, and it also seems to confirm that there was not an inventory buildup due to declining demand. That's good news for shareholders and helps indicate that today's reaction in the market doesn't make much sense. Investors will get even more information when Tesla reports its full first-quarter financial results in less than three weeks on April 19.

69,July 2024 Options Now Available For Fastly (FSLY),,"April 03, 2023 — 11:08 am EDT","['Markets', 'Stocks', 'Options']",,BNK Invest,[],"April 03, 2023 — 11:08 am EDT

BNK Invest ->


Investors in Fastly Inc (Symbol: FSLY) saw new options become available today, for the July 2024 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 473 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FSLY options chain for the new July 2024 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $15.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $15.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $11.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FSLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $16.93/share today.


Because the $15.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 23.33% return on the cash commitment, or 18.01% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.



Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastly Inc, and highlighting in green where the $15.00 strike is located relative to that history:












Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $17.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.05.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FSLY stock at the current price level of $16.93/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $17.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 33.20% if the stock gets called away at the July 2024 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FSLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fastly Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FSLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $17.50 strike highlighted in red:















Considering the fact that the $17.50 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%.  On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 29.83% boost of extra return to the investor, or 23.02% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.



Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $16.93) to be 88%.  For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

RTTNews ->


(RTTNews) - A report released by the Commerce Department on Monday unexpectedly showed a slight decrease in U.S. construction spending in the month of February.
The report said construction edged down by 0.1 percent to an annual rate of $1.844 trillion in February after climbing by 0.4 percent to a revised rate of $1.845 trillion in January.
Economists had expected construction spending to be unchanged compared to the 0.1 percent dip originally reported for the previous month.
The modest decrease in construction spending came as spending on public construction slipped by 0.2 percent to an annual rate of $391.0 billion.
Spending on educational construction slumped by 0.9 percent to a rate of $84.6 billion, more than offsetting a 0.3 percent increase in spending on highway construction to a rate of $120.6 billion.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said spending on private construction was virtually unchanged from the previous month at an annual rate of $1.453 trillion.
While spending on residential construction slid by 0.6 percent to a rate of $852.1 billion, spending on non-residential construction climbed by 0.7 percent to a rate of $601.0 billion.

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique inside view into the business, so when these insiders make purchases, investors are wise to take notice.  Presumably the only reason for a company insider to choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.  Within the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, only eleven companies have experienced such buying over the trailing six month period, one of which was Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (Symbol: WBA), where an investment totaling $339.5K was made by CEO Rosalind G. Brewer.  Click Here to Learn Which Other Ten Dow Components Also Had Recent Insider Buying »


Brewer's average cost works out to $33.95/share.  Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc were changing hands at $35.34 at last check, trading up about 2.4% on Monday.  The chart below shows the one year performance of WBA shares, versus its 200 day moving average:














Looking at the chart above, WBA's low point in its 52 week range is $30.39 per share, with $47.275 as the 52 week high point — that compares with a last trade of $35.34.



The current annualized dividend paid by Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc is $1.92/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 02/15/2023.  Below is a long-term dividend history chart for WBA, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 5.5% annualized yield is likely to continue.

Investors in iShares Inc - MSCI Brazil ETF (Symbol: EWZ) saw new options become available today, for the March 2024 expiration.

The Motley Fool ->


Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) were moving higher last month as the tech giant trended with gains in the broader tech sector as tech stocks bounced back from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and fears of a recession seemed to cool off later in the month.
There was no single driver of the stock's gains in March, though it benefited from high-profile analyst upgrades, previews of its upcoming mixed-reality headset, and signs that it's continuing to focus on cost-cutting.
According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the stock finished March up 11%. As you can see from the chart below, the stock's gains tracked with the Nasdaq, but it rose more aggressively.

^IXIC data by YCharts.
Early in March, the company got a number of bullish analyst notes. JPMorgan said that iPhone demand is high compared to Apple's competitors, while Jefferies also found that demand was strong. 
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley boosted its price target from $175 to $180, reiterating an overweight rating and citing ""pent-up"" iPhone demand and a reacceleration in its services business. 
Shortly after that, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a buy rating and a price target of $199, noting the company's growing installed base of users. 
In the week of March 13, the stock started gaining again as tech stocks rebounded after Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, and reports confirmed that the company was planning to launch a mixed reality headset in 2023 as CEO Tim Cook pushed the company to release its device this year, according to Financial Times.
Bloomberg also reported that Apple was delaying some bonuses and expanding its hiring freeze, a sign it's expanding its cost-cutting efforts as it faces macroeconomic headwinds.
Among the big tech companies, Apple is the only one that has not announced major layoffs, but it's still a cyclical business. It can't escape the overarching in tech as recessionary threats have cooled off demand, and difficult comparisons have made growth numbers weak.
Towards the end of the month, the company also introduced its own buy-now-pay-later product, ""Apple Pay Later,"" extending the reach of its payments business.
To start April, Bloomberg reported that the company is cutting a small number of corporate retail positions, another reflection of cost-cutting, and UBS said that iPhone sell-through was down 3% in February year over year, an improvement from previous months, but still a decline.
Apple shares are expensive, but its gains last month show investors are willing to pay up for quality. Even in tough times, the company appears to be strengthening its competitive advantages and putting distance between itself and challengers like Samsung and Alphabet, which should help support its elevated valuation.

(RTTNews) - The Indonesia stock market on Monday ended the two-day slide in which it had slumped almost 35 points or 0.5 percent. The Jakarta Composite Index now sits just above the 6,825-point plateau and it may tick higher again on Tuesday.
The global forecast for the Asian markets is a study in contrasts, with gains among oil stocks likely offset by weakness among the technology shares. The European and U.S. markets were mixed and the Asian bourses figure to follow suit.
The JCI finished modestly higher on Monday following mixed performances from the financials, cement companies and resource stocks.
For the day, the index added 21.90 points or 0.32 percent to finish at 6,827.17.
Among the actives, Bank CIMB Niaga rallied 2.36 percent, while Bank Central Asia collected 0.57 percent, Bank Mandiri absolutely cratered 49.03 percent, Bank Rakyat Indonesia strengthened 1.48 percent, Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison tumbled 1.80 percent, Indocement fell 0.24 percent, Semen Indonesia improved 0.79 percent, Indofood Suskes shed 0.40 percent, United Tractors dropped 0.86 percent, Energi Mega Persada soared 2.68 percent, Astra Agro Lestari spiked 2.47 percent, Vale Indonesia jumped 1.88 percent, Timah lost 0.49 percent, Bumi Resources surged 3.15 percent and Astra International, Aneka Tambang, Bank Danamon Indonesia and Bank Negara Indonesia were unchanged.
The lead from Wall Street is incongruous as the Dow and S&P opened higher and finished the same way, while the NASDAQ opened in the red and remained there throughout the session.
The Dow surged 327.00 points or 0.98 percent to finish at 33,601.15, while the NASDAQ dropped 32.45 points or 0.27 percent to end at 12,189.45 and the S&P 500 added 15.20 points or 0.37 percent to close at 4,124.51.
The strength on Wall Street rose the back of the energy sector as crude oil prices surged, while technology stocks ebbed on fears over the outlook for interest rates.
Oil prices rose sharply on Monday, buoyed by the decision of OPEC+ oil producers to cut output by around 1.16 million barrels per day. West Texas Intermediate Crude oil futures for May ended higher by $4.75 or 6.3 percent at $80.42 a barrel.
In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing activity in the U.S. contracted at a slightly faster rate in March. Also, the Commerce Department unexpectedly showed a slight decrease in U.S. construction spending in February.

Saudi Arabia produces 11 million barrels of oil a day -- and zero video games. But that ratio could soon change.
The country's Public Investment Fund will funnel $38 billion into its e-sports subsidiary Savvy Gaming Group to turn the company into a studio that develops and publishes video games.
The gaming market for years now has been bigger than the movie and music industries combined, so launching a studio may be a more obvious choice than it might appear as Saudi Arabia develops its economy in areas that don't involve, say, unexpectedly having to slash the output of fossil fuels. Even so, Savvy pivoting to developing and publishing games is quite a bold move for the PIF seeing as Saudi Arabia hasn't exactly been a gaming development mecca.
To be sure, if you're going to spin up an entire industry from scratch, a $38 billion investment is not a bad starting point, but there's no guarantee of success. Google, a company that you think would have the capital and nerdy caché necessary to pull off a foray into the gaming world, shut down its Stadia cloud gaming division earlier this year after making barely a dent in the industry. Savvy will of course have its own unique hurdles:
When in Riyadh: Even if Savvy never produces a single profitable game, it may still serve its purpose. The PIF has previously invested billions in gaming companies around the world, and Ward told Bloomberg: ""Part of our mandate is to help partners and other companies come to Saudi and choose Riyadh over some other place to establish a publishing business or distribution business to serve the region."" Usually, the point of a new venture isn't to get crowded by competition, but it looks like Saudi will take what it can get.

It's probably too late to put the champagne back in the bottle.
Some six months after biotech giant Illumina gained regulatory approval for its $7 billion acquisition of cancer-screening company Grail, the Federal Trade Commission is stepping in to overturn the decision and putting the kibosh on the entire deal.
Illumina and Grail are the Rachel and Ross of the biotech world, running a years-long on-again, off-again relationship. Grail began its life as a subsidiary of the gene-sequencing machine manufacturer, but was spun off in 2017 with the parent-company retaining 20% ownership. Its early cancer detection tests quickly took off, and Grail promptly raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round backed by high-profile names like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Google Ventures. By September 2020, Illumina decided it wanted to bring Grail and its industry-leading technology back into the family home, and, after a dust-up with the FTC, an administrative law judge last September rejected the anticompetitive allegations and ruled Illumina could move forward with the reunion.
But the FTC quickly appealed the decision, and now Illumina may need to find a cure for whiplash. On Monday, the agency unanimously voted 4-0 to reverse the ruling and ordered Illumina to unwind the acquisition:
EU, Too: Illumina has already said it will appeal the FTC's decision in federal court, and that bringing Grail back into its fold would ""expand the availability, affordability and profitability"" of its cancer-screening tests. But its problems won't end there. Illumina is also facing heat in the EU, where the European Commission is expected to soon fine the company up to 10% of its annual profits -- or nearly half a billion dollars -- for closing its acquisition in August before regulators could complete their review of the deal, and is expected to issue a similar divestment decision in the coming weeks. Maybe they should've never spun out the company in the first place.

Walmart put a fresh coat of paint on its website, giving it the social media flair of a Pinterest board or Instagram feed designed to keep you scrolling and buying and scrolling and buying and scrolling and buying...
It's the latest attempt from an e-commerce giant to adapt to spending trends and entice customers to buy things they weren't necessarily looking for when they first signed on.
Ironically, the new version of the website takes its biggest cue from in-person shopping, which requires you to walk past a bunch of stuff you don't want before you get to the item you were looking for. Online shoppers are hit with infinite ads for sponsored products they never intended on perusing. Imagine going into the supermarket, asking where to find the Oreos, and the clerk pointing you toward Pepperidge Farm Milano's because the Campbell Soup Company is paying more to be on the shelves: That's the annoying side of e-commerce these days.
With consumer spending showing signs of a slowdown, Walmart's website redesign suggests it's looking to diversify its revenue streams much like some of its biggest e-commerce competitors:
Ad-filled Amazon: That kind of seller-focused approach can rub customers the wrong way. Take Amazon. According to The Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos also owns, Amazon averages 8.5 sponsored – or ""shill"" – results on the first page of product search queries. And when it's not sponsored products, it's often in-house brands that lack the positive reviews and quality craftsmanship most consumers are looking for. In its latest quarter, Amazon's main e-commerce business of selling products directly to consumers was down 2%, but that doesn't matter to old Jeff B. As long as ad and third-party sales were up 19% and 20%, respectively.

The Hang Seng finished barely higher on Monday following gains from the energy stocks and mixed performances from the property and technology companies.
